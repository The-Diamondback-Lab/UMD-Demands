Days after the 2017 fatal stabbing of 1st Lt. Richard Collins, a Black Bowie State student, members of the University of Maryland community and others <a href="https://dbknews.com/2017/05/24/a-precious-part-in-each-of-us-has-died-umd-community-remembers-richard-collins-iii/">came together to remember</a> Collins’ life and legacy.

Brightly colored flowers, photos, small trinkets and an American flag adorned the Montgomery Hall bus stop near where he was killed — a spontaneous memorial for Collins. Later that year, the bus stop was moved near Annapolis Hall, but the shelter near Montgomery Hall remains. It’s still decorated with flowers and a portrait of Collins.

A year later, then-university President Dr. Wallace Loh <a href="https://dbknews.com/2018/04/10/richard-collins-murder-memorial-umd-wallace-loh/">announced</a> the university would be creating a permanent memorial for Collins in the future, though it would not be taking any steps toward that at the moment “​out of respect​ — and at the family’s request — for ​​privacy.”

After the former University of Maryland student who stabbed Collins was <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/01/14/umd-sean-urbanski-murder-1st-lt-richard-collins-iii-bowie-state-university-maryland-trial-hearing-sentence/">sentenced</a> to life in prison in January for first-degree murder, university President Dr. Darryll Pines announced the university’s revised plans for a physical memorial, noting that the university is working with the Collins family on its location and design.

“I am deeply affected by the magnitude of this tragedy,” Pines wrote in a campuswide email. “I know many of you feel the same.”

Now, Black student leaders, including Saba Tshibaka, are pushing the university to continue its efforts to memorialize Collins’ legacy. In their eighth demand, they call for the school to memorialize him with a “physical memorial in a visible location where all of the UMD community can participate in his remembrance.”

According to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>, the university has identified sites for a memorial that are under consideration by the Collins family, and it is aiming for this to be completed by the fall.

The demand originated from the list of demands Black Terps Matter released in July, said Tshibaka, one of the anti-racist coalition’s co-founders. The coalition is hoping to play a part in Pines’ new partnership with Collins’ family and to continue advocating for his memorialization, said Tshibaka, a fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major.

Nadia Owusu, a member of the University Senate’s Executive Committee and another co-founder of Black Terps Matter, explained that memorializing someone can manifest in different ways. It can be a physical memorial or it can be keeping that person’s story alive and teaching about it, Owusu said.

But it also comes with the continued effort to change, and in this case, to never allow what happened to Collins happen to someone else, said Owusu, a senior government and politics major.

As it stands today, the memorial near Montgomery Hall doesn’t do Collins’ story justice, Owusu said, adding that some students don’t even acknowledge its existence or know why it’s there. This is why it's so important to create a permanent physical memorial on the campus, she said.

“That’s the biggest issue — that students don’t even know what occurred there,” Owusu said. “So, memorialization is huge.”
