As an ambassador for the University of Maryland’s engineering school, Adam Ahmed visited local high schools as part of a university effort to reach prospective engineering students, he said.

He recalls connecting with a few of the students he met on a personal level; some of them were from underserved schools in Prince George’s County and Washington, D.C., and Ahmed was born and raised in D.C.

“I would really try to be a person that they could bridge the gap,” said Ahmed, a fifth-year mechanical engineering major and president of the Somali Students Association. “Show them the possibilities as a student here.”

But this outreach was only on a small scale, Ahmed said, and these sorts of programs are not enough to properly reach students from Prince George’s County and D.C. He and other Black student leaders want the university to do more to recruit students from these areas. Their sixth demand is for the school to double the current enrollment of Black students from the county and D.C. by 2025.

In fall 2020, eight percent of students at this university were from Prince George’s County, and just over one percent were from D.C., according to university data. Overall, about 11 percent of the student population was Black or African American.

“When you’re actually just walking to classes and not at these ambassador events for these kids … it doesn’t really feel like a diverse campus,” Ahmed said.

About 86 percent of African American undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the fall were from Maryland, according to information shared by the university. About 30 percent were from Prince George’s County.

In the email that university President Dr. Darryll Pines sent on his first day on the job, he noted that preliminary numbers showed that the fall 2020 freshman class would be the most diverse class on record, with an eight percent increase in the number of African American freshmen. But when data was released in October 2020, the numbers didn’t indicate that jump.

Though Hispanic enrollment for this university’s freshman class reached a four-year high in the fall, the number of freshman enrolled who identify as Black or African American only increased by about two percent. In other words, there were 11 more Black or African American freshmen than in the year before.

And this university’s demographic breakdown does not reflect that of the communities closest to College Park. Prince George’s County is 61.7 percent Black and 18.4 percent Hispanic, according to <a href="https://www.maryland-demographics.com/prince-george-s-county-demographics#:~:text=Race%20%26%20Ethnicity,%25)%20and%20White%20(12.7%25).">state data</a>. Nearby D.C. is 46 percent Black or African American, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/DC">census data</a>.

Information shared by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions detailed measures the school has taken to increase its Black student enrollment.

The office worked with high schools and community-based organizations to expand outreach and recruitment efforts and made phone calls to about 1,300 prospective students to extend the deadline and encourage them to complete their applications, according to information it provided.

The university also hosted students of color admitted to the Honors College at a reception and hosted more than 100 newly admitted students of color at an overnight stay program called Experience Diversity, Growth, and Excellence, according to the office. And according to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>, the school has built relationships with community-based organizations to host college readiness workshops throughout the year.

The Maryland Promise Program also offers scholarship support to students who exhibit “strong academic and leadership potential,” according to the dashboard; the only students from outside the state who are eligible are those from Washington, D.C., which demonstrates “the university’s commitment to supporting students from our neighboring city.”

But the university can't just sit around waiting for these students to apply, said Pauline Sow, a senior dance, economics and government and politics major. It took nearly a century after the university’s founding for it to start accepting Black students. Just because the school stopped blocking Black students from enrolling doesn’t mean they’ll suddenly feel comfortable applying, Sow said.

“That’s when you, as an institution, have to do the job of reaching back out to people who were once blocked and be like, ‘Hey, we actually really value you,’” said Sow, diversity and inclusion director for the Student Government Association. “‘Historically, we haven’t, but we actually really do.’”
