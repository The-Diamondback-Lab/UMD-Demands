As of April 5, the summary at the top of the University of Maryland’s <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a> listed two of the 25 demands from Black student leaders as completed.

The first is Demand 9, which calls for transparency and accountability from the university as it works to address the students’ demands. The school marked this demand as completed after it <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/03/10/umd-demands-black-student-leaders-critical-issues-updates-dashboard/">published its Critical Issues dashboard</a> in March.

The second is Demand 10, which calls for the university to create an oversight committee that evaluates and sanctions faculty members accused of taking part in discriminatory behavior against students.

In an update posted on the dashboard, the university said creating this sort of committee would be “inconsistent and unnecessarily duplicative” of existing processes and procedures that were approved by the University Senate after input from students, faculty and staff.

The university further explained that allegations of discrimination by faculty members are investigated and adjudicated by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct, while allegations of hate bias incidents by faculty are handled by the Office of Faculty Affairs under the school’s threatening and intimidating conduct policy.

Additionally, faculty members — just like students — can only be sanctioned after a process that “comports with due process and the First Amendment,” the dashboard reads. Sanctions against faculty members are also protected as confidential personnel matters, just like student discipline matters are privacy-protected, according to the dashboard.

Saba Tshibaka, a fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major and a co-founder of the anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter, said she understands the school’s concerns about breaching confidentiality. However, she said, the conversation about this demand shouldn’t end there.

“That just doesn’t really make sense to me,” she said.

Nadia Owusu, a senior government and politics major and another co-founder of Black Terps Matter, explained why the students included Demand 10 in their list. She said she’s heard from students — especially Black women — about times they have felt degraded in class. Some told her they have received comments from faculty that made them feel like they didn’t belong or weren’t as good as their white classmates, Owusu said.

The power imbalance between students and faculty members can deter people from coming forward, Owusu said. There’s the impression that faculty members — especially those who have tenure — will be able to keep their jobs no matter what happens, she explained. Many students also don’t know what the disciplinary process looks like for faculty members, Owusu said, adding that it isn’t well-advertised.

“It’s to better hold them accountable, have more students involved in that process and make it more equitable for all so that students aren’t afraid of that power imbalance,” Owusu said.

Tshibaka also said she wants students involved in the faculty disciplinary process. She explained that she always fights for students to be involved in campus committees. After all, they’re the main stakeholders at the university, she said, so they should be in the meetings where decisions are being made.

She pointed to the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/01/darryll-pines-umd-president-mental-health-community-policing/">community policing task force</a> university President Dr. Darryll Pines announced over the summer as an example. This committee includes a variety of people — from students and faculty members to the mayor of College Park — and it handles all sorts of sensitive information, she said. Tshibaka said she doesn’t understand why there can’t be a similar task force created for the faculty disciplinary process.

“At the end of the day, the school just needs to be truthful with what they actually see themselves as,” said Tshibaka, a fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major. “So, if they want to call themselves an anti-racist institution — which is what they’ve been doing since President Pines came in — they need to act like it.”
