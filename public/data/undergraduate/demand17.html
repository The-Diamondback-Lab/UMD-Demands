Demand 17 holds a special place in Nadia Owusu’s heart.

This demand — which calls on the university to create a racial incident hotline through the Counseling Center — was also number five in the list of demands that anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter released over the summer.

When student leaders from the coalition met with the Counseling center and Bias Incident Support Services, they decided that the existing hotline was satisfactory in meeting this demand, according to the school’s <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>. But they also agreed on another way the two offices could work together to support students.

During the latter half of last semester, Owusu met with Dr. Chetan Joshi, the Counseling Center’s director, and Brian Medina, program manager for Bias Incident Support Services, to discuss how they could create a stronger link between the two offices’ services. Through these conversations, the team agreed to create a formal referral process between the two offices to establish a more direct pipeline between the intake process at BISS and counseling services for students who would benefit from them.

Now, if a student expresses interest in mental health resources after reporting a hate bias incident, BISS will be able to reach out to Counseling Center staff to let them know what the student has experienced and what services they are looking for, Owusu explained. That student will then be able to get the help they need right away.

“Before, there was not that link,” Owusu said. “Now … they know each other by name, they know their faces, they’ve had conservations outside of those meetings. So, it’s much easier to get in contact and get those students what they need.”

The connection works the other way, too. If a student mentions to a therapist at the Counseling Center that they are thinking about talking to authorities or the Office of Student Conduct about a hate bias incident, that therapist will now know to direct them to BISS, Owusu explained.

Even before this connection was solidified, Medina said the Hate Bias Response Team, which meets biweekly and is <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/bias/team/">charged with appropriately responding to hate-bias incidents</a>, included a staff member from the Counseling Center. However, Medina said that Nadia — whom ze called an “amazing human” — encouraged hir and Joshi to advance a direct connection between their offices to support students who were experiencing mental health challenges that stemmed from identity-based trauma.

Now, Medina explained, if a student indicates they’d be interested in receiving long-term therapy, ze can work with the Counseling Center to ensure the student gets the most care possible in that transition — especially because that person could be even further traumatized if they don’t receive that support.

“That’s been amazing,” ze said.

During an internship with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Owusu said, she conducted research on microaggressions on college campuses and learned about how this more subtle form of discrimination takes a toll on a person’s long-term mental health the same way being the target of hate speech, a hate bias incident or hate crime does.

“When something becomes a norm, most times when you experience it, you just internalize it,” she said. “And that racial trauma, it goes unnoticed. And it has true long-term detrimental effects, whether that be depression, whether that be anxiety, whether that be difficulties in your classes because you automatically feel inferior, you automatically feel like you’re not as smart or you’re not going to be heard.”

The link between the two offices has helped ensure that each one knows of all the resources the other has in place, Owusu said, which has put BISS in a better position to connect people with mental health services that would best fit their needs.

“A lot of Black persons, Black students are going through a great deal of issues. And number one, there are stigmas to getting mental health help. But at the same time, those resources aren’t always marketed to them,” Owusu said. “You’d have to do some deep diving on different sites … to really know what’s out there for you. So that is why this is so important.”
