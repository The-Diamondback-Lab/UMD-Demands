In Adam Ahmed’s five years at the University of Maryland, he said, there were times he didn’t feel empowered to challenge his instructors when they did or said things that made him uncomfortable.

“You feel like you can’t do anything about it, because they’re your teacher or your TA. They do the grades,” said Ahmed, a fifth-year mechanical engineering major and president of the Somali Students Association. “You don’t want to upset them.”

Although university-administered course evaluations ask questions about whether instructors and teaching assistants treated their students with respect, they don’t include questions that specifically pertain to instances of bias or misconduct. Ahmed and other Black student leaders want this to change.

In their 24th demand, these student leaders are calling for the university to implement semesterly evaluations that address diversity and inclusion issues for every course. They also want the results of these evaluations to be published for transparency.

Under the current system, for the school to make a course’s evaluation results visible to students, 70 percent or more of students enrolled in the course must have completed the evaluation. And when the results are made public, <a href="https://confluence.umd.edu/display/courseeval/Course+Evaluation+Items">just half</a> of the course evaluation items are made visible to students. Prompts including “The instructor treated students with respect” are for instructor and authorized campus administrator visibility only.

The average response rate for course evaluations has been about 42 percent since fall 2019, according to <a href="https://confluence.umd.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=568694990">university data</a>.

According to an update posted on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the university’s Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment has convened a group that is currently working to revise student course evaluation questions.

In October 2019, then-university President Dr. Wallace Loh signed off on a series of <a href="https://www.senate.umd.edu/system/files/resources/billDocuments/16-17-24/stage9/Presidential_Approval_16-17-24.pdf">recommendations</a> issued by the University Senate’s Academic Procedures and Standards Committee to improve the school’s course evaluation method — a system that had not significantly changed since it was introduced in 2007.

In its final report, the University Senate recommended that the school consider new survey items that address several subjects, including “climate.” It lists two sample questions that could address class climate: “The instructor helps students feel welcome” and “The instructor treats students with respect.”

The report issued by the University Senate also recommended that the university continue its practice of not releasing results to students if the response rate is less than 70 percent for a given course.

Although that report does not specifically recommend including questions centered on diversity or inclusion, the group currently working to revamp the course evaluation system is exploring ways to incorporate items that touch on these topics, according to information shared by the provost’s office.

This university’s Teaching and Learning Transformation Center has also developed a <a href="https://tltc.umd.edu/mid-semester-evaluation-college-teaching">mid-semester course evaluation</a> to give instructors the chance to gather feedback before the semester ends. This evaluation — which instructors are not required to give out — asks students to indicate how much they agree with four statements about the course’s learning environment, such as, “My instructor creates an inclusive learning environment where everyone is welcome.”

Other schools around the country have included more specific questions in their end-of-semester course evaluations about diversity and inclusion efforts in classrooms.

Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://www1.villanova.edu/content/dam/villanova/opir/Course%20and%20Teacher%20Survey%20(CATS)%20Instrument.pdf">Villanova University</a> asks students to rate how much they agree that the course instructor “creates an environment free of bias based on individual differences or social identities” and “demonstrates cultural awareness.”

Brown University, which makes all close-ended items <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/support/faculty/sites/brown.edu.academics.college.support.faculty/files/uploads/2018%20Course%20Feedback%20Form%20Review%20_%20Summary%20Recommendations.pdf">visible</a> to the Brown community without a minimum response rate threshold, publishes the responses to one open-ended item for students to see. The item <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/support/faculty/sites/brown.edu.academics.college.support.faculty/files/uploads/1.%20Brown-University-Course-Feedback-Form.pdf">asks</a>, “What would you like to say about this course to a student who is considering taking it in the future?”

Some of the questions students in the <a href="https://tssw.tulane.edu/sites/tssw.tulane.edu/files/The%202020%20TSSW%20Student%20Diversity%20and%20Inclusion%20Report.pdf">Tulane University School of Social Work</a> are asked to answer include:<ul><li>“The instructor puts me in a position where I feel I must educate students about my culture/race.”</li><li>“The instructor addresses inappropriate or inaccurate statements made by other students regarding race and other issues related to diversity, such as LBGTQ, class, religion, ableism, gender, and ageism.”</li><li>“Content on race and diversity is adequately reflected in this class and course assignments.”</li></ul>

Joan Blakey, a professor at Tulane’s school of social work, said the questions were created based on situations that happened to students and issues that students voiced to her.

She said she believes moving the needle toward antiracism means some people will be uncomfortable.

“That means we’re going to be raising issues and challenging things in a way that are unconventional and new ways that we haven’t done it before,” she said. “We have been talking about these issues for years and years and years and the truth is we really haven’t moved the needle much.”
