In June, as the country was gripped by a reckoning over institutionalized racism and anti-Black violence, <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1272959695129460737">Netflix reported a 4,655 percent</a> spike in views of a then-two-year-old documentary: Ava DuVernay’s <i>13th</i>, which draws a direct line from slavery to mass incarceration and the present-day prison-industrial complex.

That same month, a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-university-of-maryland-stop-the-use-of-prison-labor-at-the-university-of-maryland">petition</a> launched by two University of Maryland students brought renewed attention to a long-simmering debate over the University System of Maryland’s continued dependence on prison labor. Much of the furniture that exists at the system’s 12 member institutions was purchased from Maryland Correctional Enterprises, the industrial arm of the state prison system.

Among the 25 critical issues identified by Black student leaders is a call for this university to divest from Maryland Correctional Enterprises and the businesses and companies invested in it. It also calls for the university to divest from the prison-industrial complex. This is a demand that was also laid out by <a href="https://protectumdemands.dbknews.com">ProtectUMD</a> in 2016 and anti-racist coalition <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/24/umd-black-terps-matter-teach-demands-protest-racism/">Black Terps Matter</a> over the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/06/26/black-terps-matter-protest-demands-umd-action-against-institutional-racism/">summer</a>.

However, university leaders have said severing the system’s relationship with Maryland Correctional Enterprises isn’t so simple. Under <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2013/article-gsf/section-14-103/">Maryland state code</a>, the University System of Maryland — as well as other “state aided or controlled entit[ies]” — is required to use the enterprises as a preferred source when buying supplies. For this reason, the University of Maryland cannot “completely control” the situation, <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/08/umd-sga-details-plan-to-reform-police-on-campus-amid-global-black-lives-matter-protests/">Dr. Darryll Pines said in an interview</a> shortly after becoming university president in July.

In an update published on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a> in March, however, the school said it would continue to study its relationship with the enterprises and invite speakers and experts to address the campus community about the prison system and its interactions with the state’s higher education institutions.

On Nov. 18, for instance, Reginald Dwayne Betts — a writer, public speaker and advocate for incarcerated people — participated in the school’s <a href="https://president.umd.edu/grandchallenges">Grand Challenges of Our Time</a> speaker series.

Pines recalled what Betts said during his talk. When Betts was incarcerated, Pines told The Diamondback in March, he said he thought about all the costs associated with his incarceration. Pines said Betts told the class that earning a minimum or living wage wasn’t important to him during the time he spent incarcerated — what mattered to him was that he gained skills. If students listened to what incarcerated people had to say about this issue, Pines said, maybe their perspectives would change.

“But yes, we are talking about it, the system talks about it, the university presidents talk about it,” Pines said. “And every time it comes up, we’re sort of locked into this law, which is not something that we created but something that was created as an opportunity to get people skills.”

He added that if people want the school’s relationship with Maryland Correctional Enterprises to change, they would have to lobby state legislators. He said that the efforts of the school alone wouldn’t be able to change the law — that would require the energy and voices of a larger segment of the community.

Saba Tshibaka, one of the three Black women who founded the anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter, said the goal of Black student leaders in including this demand was to keep the university’s relationship with prison labor as part of the conversation with administrators.

“We are working against so many forces. There are so many people against this for so many reasons,” she said. “That is just a continuous battle that I know is going to take a while. But we’re just looking to see where the school actually stands on it, so we can work from there.”

Although Maryland’s minimum wage is currently $11.75 and is set to increase to $15 by January 2025, incarcerated people who work for Maryland Correctional Enterprises make anywhere from 17 cents per hour for “unskilled labor” to $1.31 per hour for laundry and recycling collection, <a href="https://www.mce.md.gov/Portals/0/PDF2020/Annual%20Report%20-%20FINAL_Feb18_1.pdf?ver=2021-02-18-092945-210">according to the division’s 2020 report</a>. In total, the enterprises paid $2.4 million in wages throughout the 2020 fiscal year, according to the report.

Black and African American Marylanders are most likely to be the ones employed by Maryland Correctional Enterprises. According to a 2019 <a href="http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/Rethinking_Approaches_to_Over_Incarceration_MD.pdf">Justice Policy Institute</a> report, more than 70 percent of the state’s prison population was Black in July 2018 — making Maryland the state with the highest proportion of Black prisoners in the nation.

This disparity, coupled with the low wages afforded to the enterprises’ incarcerated workforce, have led some to identify prison labor as modern-day slavery.

The excess of Black people imprisoned in the state alone should be enough to inspire people to want to learn more about the university’s ties to prison labor, Tshibaka said. It’s a complicated situation, she said.

Others may have different opinions, she added, but her personal goal is to make it so that the university no longer has to prioritize the enterprises when purchasing supplies, she said. She also wants the state to increase the minimum wage for incarcerated people.

“Honestly, I want to free them all. I don’t want people suffering from the carceral state,” she said. “I want whatever is going to be best for the people currently in prison.”

In its 2020 report, Maryland Correctional Enterprises asserts that it provides incarcerated people with “much-needed work skills and work ethics.” In the report’s introduction, the enterprises’ CEO Stephen Sanders says studies suggest that correctional industries have a positive effect on reducing state recidivism rates.

“Maryland Correctional Enterprises (MCE) continually strives to accomplish its mission of providing structured employment, and training activities for offenders in order to improve employability upon release, to enhance safety and security, to reduce prison idleness, to produce quality, saleable goods and services, and to be a financially self-supporting State agency,” their mission statement reads.

Still, the enterprises generate enormous amounts of revenue each year. According to its 2020 report, total sales came out to $55.8 million that fiscal year — putting Maryland Correctional Enterprises ninth in the nation in terms of net sales generated by correctional industries.

Last year, the University System of Maryland ranked third among the enterprises’ top customers, coming behind the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and the Department of Transportation, according to the 2020 report. The system purchased $7 million worth of products in total during the 2020 fiscal year, making up 12.6 percent of the enterprises’ sales.
