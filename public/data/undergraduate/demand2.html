Adam Ahmed was a freshman at the University of Maryland when 1st Lt. Richard Collins was murdered at a campus bus stop near Montgomery Hall in May 2017.

“I was extremely disturbed, because I could have been there,” said Ahmed, now a fifth-year senior mechanical engineering major and president of the Somali Students Association. “I had a friend who was there just an hour before it happened.”

Colorism, racism and racial biases are not thoroughly discussed at this university, Ahmed said. In his experience, diversity and inclusion is always somewhat addressed in his classes — but that alone is not enough, he said. In their second demand, Ahmed and other Black student leaders are pushing for the university to create a mandatory racial bias training for all students, faculty and staff.

The training must address the nuances of microaggressions, racial stereotypes and racial biases, Ahmed said, as well as Black history at this university and the impact of racial trauma.

“That shouldn't even be that hard if you just set it up correctly,” Ahmed said.

On his first day as president of the university, Dr. Darryll Pines announced the school would be launching a pilot version of an onboarding program called TerrapinSTRONG in fall 2020 that all new students, faculty and staff would complete. According to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the program will officially launch in August. As it continues to develop, according to the webpage, the program will reach all campus community members and will incorporate racial bias training.

According to information shared by the President’s Office and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, this initiative exposes people to the university’s history, including “key figures, exclusionary practices and trailblazers.” It also discusses social identities and how they shape experiences, and provides concrete examples of ways students, faculty and staff can contribute to more inclusive and just communities, both on the campus and in the world.

Additionally, according to the Critical Issues webpage, the diversity and inclusion office is developing “anti-racism learning communities” for faculty and staff in multiple campus departments and working with the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/11/23/umd-diversity-education-requirements-task-force-university-senate-university-of-maryland-general/">Diversity Education Task Force</a> to provide content on racial bias that will be incorporated into courses.

This office is also working with the Office of Faculty Affairs and other units to incorporate implicit bias training and developing a certificate program on inclusion for employees. The office also sponsored a series of “anti-racism teach-ins” for faculty, staff and students, according to the dashboard.

Saba Tshibaka, one of the co-founders of anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter, said racial bias training has been a rallying cry since 2016, when a coalition of student organizations called ProtectUMD sent a list of <a href="https://protectumdemands.dbknews.com/">64 demands</a> to the university’s administration. These demands, which centered on protecting and empowering marginalized students on the campus, included calls for the university to implement several types of diversity training.

Tshibaka said she’s been forced to unlearn and relearn “so much” while organizing for Black Terps Matter. But no matter how much she learns and changes, she said, that will not make anyone else any less racist.

“There needs to be continuous work done, and mandatory racial bias training is the first step for that,” the fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major said.
