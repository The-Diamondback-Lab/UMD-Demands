The 20th demand from Black student leaders calls upon the university to teach students about the contributions Prince George’s County residents have made to the school, as well as the institution’s Black history, from its ties to slavery to its discrimination against Black people.

In explaining the importance of the demand, Saba Tshibaka pointed to the <a href="https://black-terps-matter.mailchimpsites.com/?fbclid=IwAR0pERyuw0LlvyR0bceYV80er0BxIf6AkxxP5YF_ZuRZbQjTzEujxRlnpCE">website of Black Terps Matter</a>, the anti-racist coalition she helped create over the summer. It devotes an entire page to detailing the history of Black student activism on the campus.

“We can’t move forward without knowing our past,” Tshibaka explained.

In an update posted to the school’s <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the university pledges to assist in creating scholarly activities, outreach and engagement opportunities for the campus community to examine “Black histories around slavery and segregation and its familial ties to UMD.”

The university has already taken some steps to do this. In September, university President Dr. Darryll Pines <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/09/04/umd-finds-new-undocumented-coordinator-announces-new-womens-studies-dept-name/">announced</a> the school’s creation of the 1856 Project, a scholarly effort co-led by university archivist Lae’l Hughes-Watkins and libraries curator for Maryland and Historical Collections Joni Floyd.

The project marked this university’s entrance into an <a href="https://slavery.virginia.edu/universities-studying-slavery/">international consortium of colleges and universities</a> dedicated to examining their connections to slavery and the slave trade, while also addressing racism and inequality in higher education.

It also follows other efforts by university community members to help the school better understand its history.

Twelve years ago, a history professor at this university, Dr. Ira Berlin, and a group of students published an account of the school’s ties to slavery entitled “<a href="https://lipa.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/digitalFile_180c4307-69c5-4126-aee1-2de9a98ad99f/">Knowing Our History.</a>” The narrative recounts that most people living in Prince George’s County were enslaved during the decade in which the university was founded; in 1850, according to the paper, the county’s population consisted of 53 percent enslaved people and 47 percent white and free Black people.

According to the account from Berlin and his students, Charles Benedict Calvert, the principal founder of the Maryland Agricultural College, was the latest in a long line of slaveholders in his family. In all, at least 16 of the university’s original 24 trustees were slaveholders, enslaving nearly 400 people in total. It took nearly a century after the first students arrived on campus for the College Park school to admit its first Black undergraduate student: Hiram Whittle.

Whittle’s admission took some time. <a href="https://mdcourts.gov/lawlib/about-us/thurgood-marshall-biography">Thurgood Marshall</a> — who went on to become the first Black justice in the U.S. Supreme Court — was unable to attend the University of Maryland’s law school in Baltimore due to the color of his skin. In 1936, Marshall and the NAACP won a case against the law school for denying the admission of a Black applicant, Donald Gaines Murray, on the basis of race.

In turn, Murray represented <a href="https://archive.hshsl.umaryland.edu/bitstream/handle/10713/12525/EMcCready_BHM_2020.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">Esther McCready</a> in her fight to desegregate the university’s nursing school — and helped Whittle gain admission. Whittle did not ultimately graduate from the university, said university archivist emerita Anne Turkos. Instead, he left after one year.

Decades later, however, the school awarded Whittle an honorary degree during its commencement ceremony in May 2020. In December, Pines also announced that a new dorm on the campus is set to be named after him and Elaine Johnson Coates, the first African American woman to graduate from this university with an undergraduate degree. The school also awarded Johnson Coates an honorary doctorate during the spring commencement ceremony.

Johnson Coates recounted her <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Njoi8-J-8mt48f5DUAj5jif7uhk0tOwzdM3RWELAUOg/edit">story to Hughes-Watkins</a> in 2019. She was one of seven Black students who were accepted in 1955, she recalled.

The girl she lived with in Caroline Hall, another Black student from her high school in Baltimore, left after her first semester because of the way she was treated, Johnson Coates said. It was a lonely time, she recalled; she ate alone in the dining hall and was insulted and harassed by her new classmates. They called her “Aunt Jemima,” the n-word and “black go home,” she remembered.

“I can pose a good front,” she told Hughes-Watkins. “Stomach may be turning over, shakes, but no one knew. Always made it a point to go to the front of the classroom, because I wanted to be up front. And I was ignored, and looked at, and ridiculed, but I had to do it.”

Having an accurate representation of history is crucial, Tshibaka said. But beyond the hardships that Black students and faculty have faced, Tshibaka stressed that the school should also celebrate and bring recognition to the changemakers and accomplishments that few may know about today.

“I think that talking to the people from Prince George’s County, finding out more about the Piscataway Tribe — the Piscataway Conoy people — is what is going to bring us together more so as a community,” Tshibaka said. “That’s why I think that demand is important.”
