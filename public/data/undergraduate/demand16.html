In September 2019, four demonstrators with the Key of David Christian Center gathered on McKeldin Mall with bright yellow signs displaying messages such as “Jesus or Hellfire” and “Feminists support pedophilia.”

They stood on the grass in front of McKeldin Library for hours, facing an <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/09/17/umd-sexist-protest-key-of-david-christian-center/">overwhelming response from hundreds of students</a> who encircled them and turned their insults into jokes. For many students, it turned into a celebration; they cheered, played music and even produced their own signs that rebutted those of the demonstrators.

Eventually, University and Prince George’s County police arrived at the scene, though no arrests were made.

Saba Tshibaka said she thinks any form of hate speech — whether it be chalked on a sidewalk or printed on signs like those of the Key of David demonstrators — should be met with action from the university. She and other Black student leaders are calling for an “immediate turnaround” for the removal of hate speech from campus property, sidewalks and boards in their 16th demand to the university.

“If it’s saying something hateful, then it should be considered a threat,” said Tshibaka, one of the founders of anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter. “If you don't know where the threat came from, you need to do an investigation. Period. If you don't have enough people in the office to do investigations for every hate speech or threat that you see on campus, you need to hire more people.”

But Tshibaka said she understands, to an extent, the university’s dilemma.

“It is an age-old conversation: censor speech or let the people talk and allow it to inspire conversations,” she said. “I guess they’re trying to protect these people’s freedom of speech.”

In an update posted on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>, the school said University Police, Residential Facilities and the incident response unit of Facilities Management respond “immediately” to cover or remove offensive materials when they get a report of their existence on the campus. Additionally, according to the dashboard, members of the incident response unit of Facilities Management walk the campus daily to look for issues that need to be addressed, including graffiti.

Brian Medina, program manager of this university’s Bias Incident Support Services, emphasized that students should understand that hate symbols and slurs are not jokes; they cause people to experience very real trauma. Honoring those who have been traumatized by seeing slurs or hate symbology is of utmost importance to BISS, Medina said. So is ensuring that others on the campus, whether they are resident assistants or campus officials, respond similarly if students confide in them about such events, ze said.

“It’s not only about the need for removal,” Medina said. “It’s also [about showing] compassion that they have experienced this trauma.”

Dr. Van Bailey, who began as <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/01/15/umd-diversity-inclusion-bias-support-services-personnel/">BISS director</a> in February, added that the program will always focus on supporting and restoring those affected by such incidents on the campus.

“We acknowledge that when these incidents happen on campus, it also gets into larger aspects of culture,” they said. “So, we want to be able to address these things by centering those who have been harmed.”
