During Pauline Sow’s sophomore year at the University of Maryland, she found a support system within an economics department initiative aiming to increase underrepresented students’ participation — and a mentor in the program’s director, Dr. Jessica Goldberg.

However, Sow said she would have benefited from a space where she could meet with other Black economics majors when she entered the department as a freshman. At that time, 11 percent of undergraduates enrolled in the economics department were Black. Last fall, it was 10 percent.

The Black Engineers Society has a space like that in Martin Hall. Sow’s been there before; her boyfriend is president of the group.

“It’s a very great, collaborative space,” said Sow, the Student Government Association’s diversity and inclusion director and a senior dance, economics and government and politics major. “People do homework there. So, there’s more space in that building for people that are engineers, where they feel comfortable going and asking someone questions about math or asking questions about anything, really.”

Sow and other Black student leaders want more spaces like the Black Engineers Society Lounge on the campus. Their 11th demand calls upon the university to create them. In doing so, Sow said, the school would be creating more safe spaces for Black students on a campus that was <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/10/19/umd-1856-project-university-maryland-slavery-segregation-racism/">not constructed with them in mind</a>; at least 16 of the university’s original 24 trustees were slaveholders, and it took nearly a century for the school to allow a Black student to enroll.

“Right now, it feels like non-Black students have the entire campus to roam around, and we just have Nyumburu or the Black Engineers Society [Lounge],” Sow said.

According to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues website</a>, the student affairs vice president is considering options for creating additional space for Black and Indigenous students and other students of color in the spaces controlled by the Division of Student Affairs. The school will provide an update during the summer, according to the website.

Dr. Patty Perillo, student affairs vice president, noted that space is limited on the university’s campus. Still, she recognized that institutions make space available for the things they value.

Perillo noted that her division oversees about 25 to 30 percent of the physical space available on the campus. From her conversations with Black students, she said she understands they want the space set aside for them to be located close to their most trusted advisers. Once her division has collected options for locations for these spaces, Perillo said the division will then involve community members in the process of creating gathering points that will serve them well.

Dr. Georgina Dodge, diversity and inclusion vice president, added that she understands why people want to have spaces to convene with others who share their identities — and that the university is trying to tackle an even broader goal.

“We are also working hard to ensure that all students feel welcome everywhere on campus and feel comfortable everywhere on campus,” she said.

A call for more Black spaces on the campus was also put forth by the anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter over the summer. During a socially distanced protest in July, the coalition’s founders called upon administrators to redirect funds from the university’s police department to the creation of these spaces.

Sow said that other Black pre-professional organizations — such as the Black Law Students Association and Black Business Association — would especially benefit from having their own lounges.

“The path towards getting a law degree or going to med school is so difficult with standardized tests and everything,” she said. “If you think of all of the resources that you need — like getting MCAT books, LSAT books — it’s very expensive. If there was one place where they could all congregate all the time, that would make it a lot easier for Black students to feel supported on their path toward graduate school.”

Sow also clarified that the spaces created through the 11th demand wouldn’t just be for Black people. In the Black Engineers Society Lounge, she said, there are people from all racial backgrounds.

“You can make a space safe for Black students even if you're not Black,” she said. “It's not the presence of non-Black people that threatens Black people. It's the behavior of racist language, things like that.”

Similarly, students who aren’t engineers are welcome in the Black Engineers Society Lounge. Saba Tshibaka studies philosophy, politics and economics, but she still has powerful memories from inside of the lounge.

“There’s no other place on campus like that lounge,” she said. “I’ve met people inside of the lounge, I’ve literally slept — like, taken four-hour naps — in the lounge. This is so important for the progression of our people.”
