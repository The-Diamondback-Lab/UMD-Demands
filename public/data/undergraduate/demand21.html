Before all of their protest and events, Black Terps Matter organizers acknowledge a “truth that is often buried”: The University of Maryland stands on the ancestral lands of the Piscataway people. A statement recognizing this aspect of the university’s history is also displayed on the homepage of the <a href="https://black-terps-matter.mailchimpsites.com">coalition’s website</a>.

Now, Black student leaders at the university want their school to take a similar step. In Demand 21, they are calling on the school to issue an official, campuswide acknowledgement that the university is built on land stolen by European colonists.

“[This fact] should be understood to the entire UMD community, not just Black students or Native American students or any individual group,” said Saba Tshibaka, a fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major and co-founder of Black Terps Matter, an anti-racist coalition.

Various units, departments and programs at the university — including the <a href="https://neur.umd.edu/about-us/land-acknowledgement">Neuroscience Major Advising Office</a>, <a href="https://stamp.umd.edu/LandAcknowledgment">Stamp Student Union</a> and the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/resources/land-acknowledgment/">Office of Diversity and Inclusion</a> —  already include land acknowledgements on their websites. According to the diversity and inclusion office, the land acknowledgement on their site was organized by Ghonva Ghauri, the coordinator for involvement and advocacy for multicultural students — including Native and Indigenous students — at the Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy office. The land acknowledgement was approved by Piscataway elders.

Tshibaka said she personally wants the university to install plaques and signs with the land acknowledgement around the campus, and for the acknowledgement to be included in course syllabi. In terms of this demand, though, Tshibaka said student leaders want the university to include a public statement on any website or public forum where it is introducing itself.

“It’s not hard, you know?” she said. “So, I just hope that people take the time.”

According to the update posted on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a> earlier this month, the land acknowledgement organized by Ghauri and Piscataway elders will be incorporated into university President Dr. Darryll Pines’ inauguration this semester, as well as the TerrapinSTRONG onboarding program in the fall.

In an interview with The Diamondback, Pines said the statement approved by Piscataway elders will be included on his website. He said the university will continue working with the elders to see how they would like to be represented and to “keep this issue front and center.”

“Yes, the comments from the students, the recommendations from the students are great,” he said. “But it’s what the elders want … They hold the lion’s share of this decision process for us.”

ProtectUMD — a coalition of more than 25 student groups formed in November 2016 — also <a href="https://protectumdemands.dbknews.com">included a call for the university to acknowledge that it stands on Indigenous land</a> in its list of 64 demands. And in 2019, the American Indian Student Union <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/11/22/tribal-land-acknowledgment-umd-university-american-indian-students-big-ten/">started a petition</a> for the university to issue an official, campuswide land acknowledgement, coupled with plaques and signs around the campus. The student union’s effort began after some of its members attended the Big Ten Native American Conference at Indiana University, where they said they realized some other schools had done more than this university to support Indigenous students; Indiana University, for instance, has a First Nations Education and Cultural Center.

The <a href="http://www.piscatawayconoytribe.com/history.html">Piscataway Conoy Tribe’s website</a> includes an account of the Piscataway people’s culture. Historically, according to the website, they were a confederacy of tribes extending between the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay to the watershed of the Potomac River and included all land from the southern tip of St. Mary’s County to Baltimore, Montgomery and Anne Arundel counties and Washington, D.C.

The confederacy had its first encounter with a European colonist in 1634, according to the website, when Jesuit priest Father Andrew White arrived from England with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonard-Calvert">Leonard Calvert</a>, the Maryland colony’s first governor. Tribal leadership established its first treaty with Lord Baltimore in 1666, according to the website, which resulted in the formation of a reservation.

“Several other treaties and reservations were established throughout the years; however, they would all eventually be broken by encroachment of the settlers and lead to our ancestors losing their homelands,” the website reads.

Frustrated and angry, some tribal members migrated to northern Virginia and eventually into Pennsylvania to avoid further encroachment, according to the website. Those who remained in Maryland established communities throughout Calvert, Prince George’s and Charles counties. Today, the Piscataway Conoy people live on land throughout southern Maryland once occupied by their ancestors, including Upper Marlboro, Oxon Hill, LaPlata and Brandywine.

“We just know where we’re coming from, and with gratitude and with respect to our history,” Tshibaka said. “And everyone else should too. Shared history.”
