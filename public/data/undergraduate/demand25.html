University of Maryland President Dr. Darryll Pines announced the school’s TerrapinSTRONG initiative during his first day on the job.

Starting that fall, Pines told the campus community in his July 1 email, all students, faculty and staff members who were new to the university would participate in an onboarding program that would focus on “what it means to be a Terrapin and to exhibit Maryland Pride.” The program would also include training on unconscious bias, anti-racism, diversity, equity and inclusion and sexual harassment, he wrote.

In Demand 25, Black student leaders are calling for this program to also teach students how to report hate bias incidents and access counseling services. They also want the program to include information on the resources available to Black and Indigenous students and other students of color.

According to an update the university posted on its <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the onboarding program — portions of which were piloted in the fall — is set to officially launch in August. The update confirmed that the program would include resources on bias incident reporting and counseling services, including additional resources for students of color.

Key aspects of the onboarding program include an introduction to the community’s traditions, values and expectations; discussion of social identities and how they shape experiences; ways community members can promote justice and inclusion on the campus and in the world; and exposure to the school’s history, including key figures, exclusionary practices and trailblazers, according to information shared by the president’s office and the diversity and inclusion office.

The onboarding program is organized into four modules and includes interactive videos, “knowledge checks,” and an invitation for people to reflect on how the training’s vision relates to their journey at the university. The training will have captions and will be translated into Spanish and other languages as needed, according to the information these offices provided.

Staff members developing the program are led by Dr. Carlton Green — director of diversity training and education in the university’s diversity and inclusion office — and Ramsey Jabaji, acting director of the engineering school’s Office of Global Engineering Leadership.

Saba Tshibaka says Green’s role in developing the program is one of the reasons she’s hopeful about the future of TerrapinSTRONG. His work was recognized on a local and national level when he served as a staff psychologist at the university’s Counseling Center. During the 2016-17 academic year, he received the Division of Student Affairs Outstanding Service Award, and he was named a Diversity Scholar by the Association of Counseling Center Training Agencies in 2016.

“In all of these different committees, I’m just hoping that the people that have been placed there do what they need to do to get the change,” said Tshibaka, a fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major. “All I can do is hope.”
