The way the University of Maryland responds to hate speech and other hate bias incidents has been one of the “hottest topics” Black student leaders have discussed in their meetings with administrators, senior government and politics major Nadia Owusu said.

Microaggressions and hate bias incidents have long-lasting effects on students, said Owusu, who also serves on the University Senate Executive Committee. In fact, she said, these incidents also may develop into hate crimes if they go unnoticed or unchecked.

So, when a hate bias incident takes place and the administration is silent, it feels as if it is not on the side of marginalized communities, Owusu said.

“These are deep issues that are impacting us,” she said. “We want to hear that response from them — to hear about the incident and understanding the facts and understanding what exactly is going to be done about it.”

Fourth on the list of 25 demands from Black student leaders is a call for the university to immediately respond to hate speech and other hate bias incidents — and to issue consequences for these actions.

Owusu said she would like the university to issue campuswide emails whenever a hate bias incident occurs, including information about what is currently known of the situation and a timeline for how the incident will be investigated.

“That would bring a greater awareness to what minoritized communities are going through on campus,” Owusu said. “I think it’s very important for students to know the severity of this issue, which urges more people to want to combat it.”

Dr. Patty Perillo, student affairs vice president, and Dr. Georgina Dodge, diversity and inclusion vice president, shared some reasons the system Owusu described may not be feasible.

For one, Dodge said, broadcasting information about a hate bias incident is not often in the best interest of the student who was harmed. Having their information shared on a wide scale might be retraumatizing for this student, she said.

Perillo added that seeing information about specific hate bias incidents could also be retraumatizing for others who share an identity with the student who was targeted. However, she noted that Owusu’s suggestion is one she has heard from other students at institutions where she’s previously worked.

“Social psychologists and psychologists would say, ‘You’ve got to be really careful about the institutional messages that you continue to send out,’ because they can cause harm in and of themselves,” she noted.

Under the <a href="https://clerycenter.org/policy-resources/the-clery-act/">Clery Act</a>, this university — like other colleges and universities that receive federal funding — is required to compile campus crime statistics in an <a href="http://www.umpd.umd.edu/stats/AnnualSecurityReport.pdf">annual security report</a> that is available to students and employees. University Police also issue <a href="http://www.umpd.umd.edu/stats/clery.cfm">UMD Alerts or UMD Safety Notices</a> to notify campus community members of crimes considered to represent a threat to students and employees, according to the department’s website.

The annual security reports include statistics on any hate crimes that occurred in the jurisdiction of University Police. But hate crimes are different than hate bias incidents. According to this university’s <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/bias/team/">Bias Incident Support Services</a> program, bias incidents are “characterized by some expression of bias against a particular group” and can range from actions considered to be offensive to actions that cause harm. Bias incidents are sometimes classified as hate crimes, but not always.

Hate crimes involve a criminal act that is motivated “in whole or in part” by the perpetrator’s hate or bias toward an individual or group because of their membership in that group.

On the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the university says it will seek to impose sanctions when threatening and intimidating action takes place and will involve the Office of Student Conduct, the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct and University Police as appropriate. Additionally, according to the webpage, the student affairs division has formed a work group with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to review the division’s policies regarding hate bias incidents and work to establish “common language” among all of its departments.

The student affairs division will keep the academic affairs division informed on the work group’s progress so they can aim for uniformity in policy, according to the dashboard. This work is expected to be finished in August.

The Bias Incident Support Services program exists to ensure a streamlined and effective process for handling hate bias incidents and to provide support to those affected by these sorts of incidents, according to <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/bias/">its website</a>. When a student reports a hate bias incident to BISS, the program holds an intake conversation with the student and will follow up with ongoing check-ins. What happens next is up to the affected student, said Brian Medina, BISS program manager. Ze explained that the office uses restorative practices when responding to hate bias incidents.

“For anybody who encounters ... symbols or messages or retraumatization of some other form, restorative practices give ownership back to them in order to heal that harm,” ze said. “It starts first and foremost by centering the individual, acknowledging said harm, naming that danger, naming that bias that is impacting them.”

Medina detailed some steps BISS might take to respond to a hate bias incident. If the student wants to have a conversation with the person who harmed them, for instance, ze could mediate the interaction to ease communication between parties and ensure that power dynamics do not complicate matters. Or, if BISS receives an anonymous report about an incident that occurred in a specific department, Medina said ze could coordinate implicit bias training for that department.

However, BISS is not a sanctioning body; instead, the office may refer incidents to other offices as needed, such as the University Police, the civil rights and sexual misconduct office or the student conduct office, which may issue sanctions.

Early last semester, BISS launched a <a href="https://umd.edu/bias-reporting-dashboard">regularly updated dashboard</a> that tracks reports of hate bias on and around the campus. As of April 5, 46 bias incidents have been reported in 2021. Thirty-five reports have been related to race or color and two have been related to national origin. The remaining nine are split between sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, ethnicity, ability and other.

Saba Tshibaka recalled an example of an incident from over the summer, when two people posed for a <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/06/06/social-media-umd-university-of-maryland-student-conduct-office/">photo mocking the killing of George Floyd</a>. The photo circulated on social media as many students and alumni from this university responded with shock and disgust. In a statement provided to The Diamondback in June, the university condemned the actions and images and said it had referred those involved to the Office of Student Conduct.

A little over two months later, when university President Dr. Darryll Pines was <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/08/28/umd-pines-bfsa-systemic-racism-unions-fall/">asked whether there had been a resolution</a> to the incident during a Black Faculty and Staff Association meeting, he said he didn’t know and would have to look into it.

Tshibaka, a co-founder of the anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter, remembers how disappointing this response was for her.

“Not only does it hurt me as a student that I had to be traumatized as a Black woman to have to see [the photo],” the fifth-year senior studying philosophy, politics and economics said. “But on top of that, I had to be smacked in the face with just kind of the nonchalant-ness from my new Black president about that in real time.”

Still, Tshibaka mentioned, she’s been pleased with BISS’s new dashboard so far.

Owusu said she is concerned that some students may not know about the support and services BISS provides. To rectify this problem, she said the university could include information about the office on any emails it sends out about hate bias incidents. Perillo could also promote the office in the weekly emails she sends to the community, Owusu said, and Pines could do the same on emails he sends out about the Black Lives Matter movement or steps the university has taken to promote anti-racism.

“Always showing that renewed commitment — that [hate] is something that will not be tolerated on campus,” Owusu said. “It’s something that will constantly, always be addressed. And it’s not something to be taken lightly.”
