Pauline Sow has received counseling provided by the University of Maryland twice during her time at the school — once in her freshman year and another time in her senior year. Both times, Sow said, she was lucky enough to have a counselor who, like her, is a Black woman.

Sow attended a high school in Bethesda, a community located north of Washington, D.C., that is less than <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/bethesdacdpmaryland/AGE295219">five percent Black</a>. Sow said she had lots of experiences with discrimination, which only exacerbated the other sorts of trauma she was experiencing — although she didn’t realize it at the time.

“Being able to talk to my counselor about childhood trauma and then at the same time being able to talk to her about discrimination and racial trauma — that's something very unique that you can only do with a counselor that looks like you,” said Sow, a dance, economics and government and politics major.

Sow’s experiences are the reason she’s passionate about increasing the number of Black and Indigenous counselors and other counselors of color at this university’s counseling and health centers, especially those who have experienced discrimination. The fifth demand from Black student leaders calls upon this university to do just that.

Currently, approximately 33 percent of the Counseling Center’s psychologists — including doctoral student interns who work full-time and provide psychological services — are Black or African American, according to data from the center. Students can request to be paired with a therapist of a preferred background, such as race, according to information provided by the center.

In the 2018-19 academic year, 14 percent of students who sought counseling services were Black or African American, according to an annual Counseling Center report. That same year, 10.6 percent of all undergraduate and graduate students were Black or African American.

Staff members at college counseling centers nationwide are predominantly white. A 2019 <a href="https://www.aucccd.org/assets/documents/Survey/2019%20AUCCCD%20Survey-2020-05-31-PUBLIC.pdf">study</a> found that 70 percent of about 3,700 counseling center staff members were white, compared to the roughly 12 percent who were Black.

In addition, students of color are more likely to feel overwhelmed than white students, but they are less likely to seek mental health treatment, according to a 2020 <a href="https://www.stevefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CRISIS-RESPONSE-TASK-FORCE-STEVE-FUND-REPORT.pdf">report</a> by The Steve Fund, an organization dedicated to improving mental health among students of color.

When Sow talks about the importance of diversity among counselors, she thinks about the time after the death of 1st. Lt. Richard Collins, a Black Bowie State University student who was murdered by a former student of this university in 2017. Traumatic times such as these, she said, necessitate a diverse team of counselors.

And incidents of racial bias are never-ending, Sow said, highlighting the importance of helping people who may be affected by such events.

“Sometimes the focus is on, ‘How do we make sure this never happens again?’ which is the right focus,” she said. “But it's also, ‘How do we help the students who have unfortunately already experienced [racial bias?]’”

Dr. Chetan Joshi, the Counseling Center’s director, noted that students from minority backgrounds often face challenges in accessing mental health care, such as cultural beliefs or financial barriers. He said he often hears from students of color that they would feel more comfortable seeking care if staff members looked like them. Additionally, he said, these staff members can serve as role models to students; he’s heard many stories of students of color entering the mental health field after having a positive experience with a clinician who looks like them.

Diversity and inclusion have always informed hiring decisions at the Counseling Center, Joshi said. Staff members also receive training on social justice issues, diversity, inclusion and cultural sensitivity while they are in graduate school, he added.

“The consideration regarding diversity and inclusion at the Counseling Center is not just an external concept,” he said. “It is a lived experience and a core part of our work and identity.”

The <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a> also states that a proposal calling for the hiring of additional staff has been submitted; “Diversity considerations will, as always, be central to any additional hirings,” the website reads.

According to information provided by the center, it also offers identity-based group counseling and maintains liaison relationships with units such as Nyumburu Cultural Center, the Office of Multi-ethnic Student Education and Academic Achievement Programs. Additionally, the center is in the process of establishing monthly meetings with Black student leaders through the Student Success Initiative, according to the information it provided.

However, Joshi explained that it would be against human resources guidelines and ethics to ask a candidate about their experiences with discrimination in an interview. Still, he said a candidate’s understanding of diversity, inclusion and social justice-related issues plays a central role in the center’s hiring decision-making process.

“We have multiple questions each time — both at the phone interview, as well as the in-person interview — that are directed at soliciting information about the candidates’ understanding of their own intersectional identities, how they impact their clinical work, questions about how the candidate works with clients from diverse backgrounds,” he said.

“If a candidate were to share their expeirence with discrimination and how they navigated that experience, that would only serve to further improve our understanding of the candidate’s insight into their identity and about diversity and inclusion-related issues in general,” Joshi later added.

Shanell Erhunmwunse is the founder of this university’s Multi-Ethnic Mental Health Organization, which provides a space for students, particularly students from marginalized backgrounds, to learn about how to maintain their mental health.

Erhunmwunse is Sierra Leonean and Nigerian, and when selecting a therapist, she leans toward someone who is Black, she said. Part of this decision stems from what she experienced growing up in an African household, where addressing mental health is often not prioritized, she said.

“I feel as though [a Black therapist] would understand much better, considering my experiences when it comes to not feeling like I have the complete range to be as expressive or maintain my mental health as much as I believe I could have done or as much as I could have learned growing up,” she said.

Though she has not sought help from this university’s Counseling Center, opting instead to seek therapy off-campus, Erhunmwunse is optimistic that administrators will do more to diversify the counselors at this university, she said.

“Considering that our president is a Black male, then I would assume that he understands the seriousness of having a diverse staff at the Counseling Center,” she said. “I do fully believe that our administration will take the initiative to see these facts and then act on them.”
