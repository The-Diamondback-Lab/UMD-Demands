It wasn’t until Pauline Sow did her own research during her junior year at the University of Maryland that she realized how many internships and opportunities were specifically geared toward Black students, she said.

The senior dance, economics and government and politics major said she found it odd she hadn’t known that earlier. After all, she said, it’s the University Career Center’s job to help students — especially those who might have a harder time gaining opportunities, such as students from underrepresented groups — figure this sort of thing out. And a conversation with a Career Center representative didn’t boost Sow’s confidence that the office was taking steps to address her concerns either, she said.

“It’s not my job as a student to figure out what opportunities exist out there for me, when I’m paying money to an institution that claims to set me up for better opportunities,” Sow said.

That conversation is what really got the ball rolling for what would become the seventh demand from Black student leaders, Sow said. Demand 7 is a call for the university to create a Black career center to better expose Black students to scholarships, conferences and internships that value Black people.

She gave a few examples of what this center could look like. Maybe it could be a separate facility that houses a collaboration between the Career Center and Nyumburu Cultural Center or the school’s diversity and inclusion office, she said. A separate division within the Career Center could also be cool, she said.

“Maybe not necessarily a whole completely different building, but there does need to be a space that highlights opportunities for underrepresented minorities,” she said.

According to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the University Career Center has convened “diversity, equity and inclusion partners” on the campus to gather insight on how to improve resources for Black students. It plans to engage the Black Student Union and Black Alliance Network in similar discussions and to establish regular meetings with Black student leaders.

There are several existing programs that can be coordinated with Nyumburu this spring, according to the website, and the university is in the early stages of planning additional programming. The school is partnering with the Student Success Initiative, the Black Honors Caucus and the Center for Minorities in Engineering in these efforts, among other campus departments and offices, according to the dashboard.

Sow said she has conflicting feelings about this demand. On one hand, she said, it shouldn’t be up to Black students and other marginalized groups on the campus to fill in the gaps of services the center should have been providing all along. But at this point, she said, she doesn’t trust the center to do the work itself.

“At the end of the day, there’s so many resources and so many employers that specifically want underrepresented minorities that, until the Career Center gets it together, other members of the community need to jump in to make sure that Black students are being addressed,” she said.

Dr. Ronald Zeigler, Nyumburu’s longtime director, said he’s heard Black students say the resume consultations they receive from the Career Center are superficial. He’s passed these concerns on to the center’s director and is currently working with a task force to improve the center’s strategies for connecting with and serving students of color, he said.

However, although Nyumburu has been happy to host workshops in collaboration with  the Career Center over the years, Zeigler said the Cultural Center is not prepared to offer these resources full-time.

“I think it’s a valid demand. I think it’s quite valid,” he said. “But I think the solution, in my opinion, is for the Career Center to try to address the issues that the students have brought up to them.”

Though Sow said she’d feel the most comfortable with an entity separate from the Career Center providing resources geared toward underrepresented student groups, hearing about the task force that Zeigler is serving on gave her cause for optimism.

“Since Dr. Z is working with them — which again, comes back to the whole point that it is not his job to work with them — then I’m hopeful,” she said. “Honestly, I’m open to it. I feel like that could help.”
