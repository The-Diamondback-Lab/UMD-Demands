When the University of Maryland’s women’s studies department changed its name to the Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Saba Tshibaka didn’t see the move as enough of a change.

“Love Harriet Tubman. Love her to life and death,” said Tshibaka, one of the founders of anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter. “But that’s not helping any Black students in the current day.”

Instead, the university must use their platform to do something greater, Tshibaka said. In Demand 19, Tshibaka and other Black student leaders are calling on the university to promote change and support Black students by partnering with organizers in the Prince George’s County area. The student leaders hope this will help the university improve relations with the county.

Tshibaka pointed to partnerships the university has already made to support Black students. In October, the school joined up with Bowie State University to create the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/10/02/umd-bowie-state-social-justice-alliance-richard-collins-murder/">Social Justice Alliance</a> in honor of 1st Lt. Richard Collins, a Black student who was murdered on the campus in 2017, days before he was set to graduate from Bowie State. Then, in January, the university announced a <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/01/27/umd-maryland-partnership-jordan-mcnair-foundation/">partnership with the Jordan McNair Foundation</a> to celebrate the late Maryland football player’s life and legacy.

In an update published on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a> on March 25, the university said its relationship with the county has “never been stronger.” According to the update, the school participates in a “wide range” of partnerships and groups with the county, including the College Park-City University Partnership and monthly meetings with College Park and county officials, as well as meetings between the University Health Center and county officials about COVID-19 and other public health matters.

Also according to the update, hundreds of campus community members are engaged with schools and nonprofits surrounding the university, including during annual events such as <a href="https://oce.umd.edu/good-neighbor-day">Good Neighbor Day</a> and <a href="https://www.pgcc.edu/about-pgcc/events/event-details/a-college-education-is-within-your-reach.php">A College Education is Within Your Reach/Estudios Universitarios a su Alcance</a>. The update also pointed to the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/04/01/college-park-umd-daycare-childcare-bright-horizons-affordability-tuition/">UMD Child Development Center</a> and the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/02/17/umd-college-park-new-city-hall-construction/">City Hall block project</a> as further examples of city and university partnerships.

Additionally, according to information sent by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, the school has fostered relationships with other organizations throughout the county, including <a href="https://www.pgcjackandjill.org">Jack and Jill of America, Inc</a>, <a href="https://fgcb.org">First Generation College Bound</a> and <a href="https://collegetrack.org/communities/college-track-durant-center/">College Track at the Durant Center</a>, among others.

There are other organizations in the county Tshibaka said the university should consider collaborating with. One of them, she said, is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pgchangemakers/?hl=en">PG Change Makers</a>.

Amity Pope, an alumna of this university, officially co-founded the organization with Krystal Oriadha after the killing of George Floyd. Their mission is to examine systems of oppression and racism and work to dismantle them through direct actions, campaigns, lobbying and more.

When it comes to the demand, activists need to make sure they have shared power with the university, Oriadha said. These partnerships should not simply be about checking a box on the list, she added.

Simply hosting a meeting with advocates once a year could be labeled as partnership, she said. But if the university shifts its resources back into the community, it will be creating opportunities for people, Oriadha said, and that’s the type of partnership that is truly valuable.

The moment the university decides that certain behaviors — such as racism — will not be tolerated, that’s when change will happen, Oriadha said.

“These people didn’t just turn racist,” she said. “The environment said that they could behave that way.”
