Over the summer, as Nadia Owusu, Saba Tshibaka and Alysa Conway planned an anti-racist protest to take place on the campus, they connected with Black alumni who had fought for change at the school when they were students.

This was in June, before the women knew what Black Terps Matter would become. However, something stood out to Owusu during her conversations with alumni; they had raised many of the same issues when they attended the university that she and her fellow student leaders were still raising, decades later.

The message came loud and clear from the alumni they spoke to, Owusu said. For Black student leaders and their allies to make lasting change at the university and in the surrounding community, she said the alumni explained, they would need to ensure that others could continue the fight once they had graduated and that mechanisms would be in place to guarantee administrators follow through with their promises.

“Us undergraduate students, we’re only here for four years and then we’re moved out, while administrators and faculty and staff stay,” Owusu said. “So, a lot of times, they give us some attention and when we’re gone and we’re graduated, they move away from those issues because they don’t have anybody breathing down their necks anymore.”

The advice Owusu, Tshibaka and Conway received over the summer eventually became the foundation for the ninth demand from Black student leaders: a call for accountability and transparency as university officials moved forward in addressing their demands and working to create equity for the Black community on campus.

On March 10, the university <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/03/10/umd-demands-black-student-leaders-critical-issues-updates-dashboard/">launched a dashboard</a> to track its progress in addressing each demand. The <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">webpage</a> includes updates on each critical issue and provides a summary of which have been met so far. As of April 5, the summary at the top of the dashboard lists two demands as completed, seven as ongoing and 16 as in progress.

So far, Owusu has been encouraged by university leaders’ work to honor this request. Every three to four weeks, she and other Black student leaders meet with Dr. Patty Perillo, student affairs vice president, and Dr. Georgina Dodge, diversity and inclusion vice president, among other administrators. University President Dr. Darryll Pines also attends most meetings, Owusu said. She stressed the importance of these meetings and the importance of keeping the university community updated on the progress in fulfilling the demands.

“It’s very important because, as we’ve seen, Black Lives Matter became a trend over the summer. And trends come and go,” Owusu said. “The commitment needs to come after the commercials and the T-shirts and the social media posts — it needs to be constant to actually make real, sustainable, equitable change. It doesn’t just happen when a hashtag comes out.”

In November 2016, in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election, a coalition of student organizations called <a href="https://protectumdemands.dbknews.com">ProtectUMD</a> sent a letter to then-university President Dr. Wallace Loh with 64 demands on the behalf of various marginalized communities on the campus.

Two months later, Loh responded to ProtectUMD’s letter in a campuswide email. He informed community members that senior administrators had determined that many of the demands had already either been addressed or were set to be addressed. Some would require consultation with and approval by other bodies within the university, he wrote, and some would not be implemented because they were “unlawful, or impractical, or unnecessary.”

Four years later, few of ProtectUMD’s 64 demands have been met, and many are echoed within the 25 demands of the Black student leaders.

Still, Owusu is optimistic that the change she and fellow student leaders are calling for will stick this time, especially because it was administrators who asked them for a list of demands in the first place.

In the future, she hopes university officials will do a better job of keeping the entire community in the loop about what they’ve been discussing with Black student leaders, whether that’s in the form of campuswide emails or open forums. That would encourage people to reach out to student leaders with questions or suggestions and allow for greater transparency and accountability, Owusu said.

Meanwhile, she and Tshibaka have been striving to lay the groundwork for their peers to take over the fight once they graduate in May. With more than 3,300 followers on Instagram, anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter has long used social media to get the word out. Owusu and Tshibaka also met with the Prince George’s County Young Democrats to discuss the demands last month. When it comes time for the next cohort of undergraduates to take over, they’ll know they have the support of that coalition, Owusu said.

“It’s on ... future students to be very proud of the change that they are making and not be scared or shy to say, ‘I want a better campus for myself and the future,’” Tshibaka said. “Because that’s the only way we’re gonna get it.”
