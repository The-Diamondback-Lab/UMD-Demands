As of April 5, Demand 14’s status is listed as “complete and ongoing” on the University of Maryland’s <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>.

In this demand, Black student leaders are calling for University Police to implement continuous mandatory training on implicit bias in policing and how to reduce its negative effects on the school’s community. According to information posted on the Critical Issues dashboard, though, University Police officers already receive this sort of information.

In spring 2017, the department updated its training to include modules on fair and impartial policing, according to information provided by University Police. Now, every officer in the department receives annual training on bias-based and impartial policing, as well as on hate crimes and hate bias, according to this information, and all officers also receive a “diversity refresher” training annually.

University Police Chief David Mitchell provided further information about the training officers receive in an interview with The Diamondback over the summer. He explained that officers learn about the history of racism in policing and learn to handle situations involving people with mental health issues and disabilities. Additionally, except for in a handful of situations, officers are <a href="https://www.umpd.umd.edu/about/manual.cfm">barred</a> from treating people differently because of their race, ethnicity, gender or “other improper criteria.”

Still, Black Terps Matter co-founder Saba Tshibaka is dubious about the extent to which University Police officers understand the negative effect that biased policing has on the campus community.

“The way that they see policing right now — if they want it to work, then they need to collaborate with the community more and they need to work to fix the issues in the community more,” she said.

University Police have implemented a number of measures to improve their relationship and build trust with the community, according to information provided by the department. All patrol officers began wearing body cameras in 2015, according to the information, and police have also engaged in a number of community outreach events and partnerships, including the Student Government Association’s UMPD Student Advisory Committee and the Resident Hall Association’s Resident Police Committee.

Over the summer, university President Dr. Darryll Pines also announced the <a href="https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-community-policing">Task Force on Community Policing</a>. The task force — which includes University Police officers, a Fraternal Order of Police president, faculty and students — aims to improve community-police relations. According to its website, the group is paying particular attention to the department’s progress on hate bias training, racial profiling and the use of force.

In October, behavioral and social sciences dean and task force co-chair Gregory Ball told The Diamondback that the task force expected to release their recommendations by January or February. However, the task force later <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/03/08/umd-policing-task-force-pushes-back-recommendations-release/">pushed back this deadline</a> until the end of the spring semester. In an interview with The Diamondback, Pines said the task force’s leadership indicated the group needed more time to engage the community before issuing its final report.

This delay makes it evident the University Police do not have the knowledge of the negative effects that biased policing has on the campus, Tshibaka said. If it did, the task force — which features several police officers — would not need the extended time to hear from the community, she said.

“That's a fallacy in itself,” she said.

But Pines urged students to be patient. Nothing changes overnight, he said — especially not an entity that has been around for decades.

“They requested the extension because they wanted to engage the community further and get all the different attitudes and opinions,” he said. “I think that’s the prudent thing to do.”

Tshibaka said she wants to see the University Police defunded and that money used to fund Black spaces instead.

“I don't expect much out of the police to help me as an individual Black woman, especially since I'm an activist,” she said. “If I could put out there into the universe something that I'd want the police to do, it would be to show that they genuinely care about the Black people in the community. I don't know how they're going to do that.”
