Growing up, Adam Ahmed shuffled in and out of private and public schools. He attended the Washington International School for elementary school, then moved to Saudi Arabia and went to a British school there for a while. Then, for middle and high school, he was back in Washington, D.C.

But no matter where Ahmed was going to school, there was a common thread: few of his teachers were Black.

When he came to the University of Maryland in 2016 to study mechanical engineering, this trend continued. Ahmed, president of the Somali Students Association, is now a fifth-year senior and, he said, has never had a Black engineering professor. However, he said, in his freshman year he took a math class taught by Dr. Kasso Okoudjou, a Black man from West Africa.

Okoudjou gave him life lessons and instilled confidence in him, Ahmed recalled. Though he had never struggled to see himself as a capable student, he said, it was rare for him to relate to an educator in this way.

And, he said, although he never had Dr. Kendall Williams for class, the math professor still invited Ahmed into his office hours with “open arms” and sought to help him.

“Those things are really good for retention rates. Making people feel more at home and comfortable,” Ahmed said. “When you’re in the classroom, it can be really alienating — and I’m a man, at that. There are very few women in mechanical engineering, for example, so if you’re a Black woman, it’s much more difficult.”

Black student leaders at this university want more Black students to have the sort of experience Ahmed had with Okoudjou and Williams. The first on their list of 25 demands is a call for the university to increase its number of Black faculty, staff, teaching assistants, administrators and advisers.

As of last semester, about 25 percent of staff members at this university were Black. For faculty members, this number was six percent — about 28 percent of whom were tenured or on the tenure track. In comparison, 57 percent of faculty members were white last semester, 36 percent of whom were tenured on the tenure track.

This isn’t the first time the university is being called upon to boost diversity among its faculty. Both the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2018/11/22/umd-diversity-inclusion-report-external-review-hate-bias-incident-odi/">final report</a> of an external review the university commissioned following the murder of 1st Lt. Richard Collins and the report from a <a href="https://dbknews.com/2018/04/25/diversity-inclusion-task-force-approved-umd/">task force</a> the school charged around the same time recommended that the school <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/docs/DI-Recommendations-and-Commonalities.pdf">increase its number of underrepresented faculty</a>.

The university says it is working to diversify its staff and faculty. On its <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, it says that the school has made several exceptions to its pandemic-prompted hiring freeze for “underrepresented minority faculty with whom [it is] actively negotiating.” The school also reports on this dashboard that it has clearly communicated to all departments on the campus that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority. Additionally, the university is developing “financial incentives” so that it may compete with other employers, according to the webpage.

On the dashboard, the school says its goal is to be a leader among universities that are members of the Association of American Universities in terms of the diversity of its faculty, staff and student body. And, according to a statement, university President Dr. Darryll Pines will soon announce a multimillion dollar investment aimed at boosting the school’s competitiveness in hiring underrepresented tenure-track faculty members. Details about this effort will be made available during his inauguration in April, according to the statement.

Earlier this year, the university also kick-started its involvement in the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/12/31/aspire-alliance-umd-university-of-maryland-faculty-diversity-and-inclusion/">Aspire Alliance</a>, a program funded by the National Science Foundation that aims to help universities recruit and retain more STEM faculty members from underrepresented backgrounds. In doing so, the initiative ultimately seeks to bring more students from similar backgrounds into STEM programs.

Besides helping to increase the Black student enrollment at the university, Ahmed says there are other benefits of having more Black faculty members. For one, he said, Black students at predominantly white institutions like this university can often feel like they’re being asked to be “ambassadors” for their community. It’s a burden, Ahmed said. It means these students are expected to pitch into discussions about diversity and inclusion, he said, even if they don’t want to.

But having a Black educator means the instructor can be the one playing that role, Ahmed said, which can remove that pressure from students.

“When you are 18, 19, it’s empowering to have people you can relate to in those positions, that can handle the discussions and impart an important message to the students that don’t really even know any Black people,” he said.

Saba Tshibaka, a co-founder of the anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter, shared stories of how Black faculty members have lifted her up throughout her time at this university.

Brandon Dula, a Black assistant director at the Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy office, supported Tshibaka starting with their first encounter, when he realized that she wanted to make change on the campus, she said. Traci Dula, an associate director for the Honors College, was a mentor for Tshibaka in the Black Honors Caucus. Through Traci Dula, Tshibaka learned a lot of the campus’s Black history, she said.

These connections are important, Tshibaka said. Through Black faculty and staff, Black students learn about Black student organizations and about pioneer Black students such as Hiram Whittle, Tshibaka said.

“Traci Dula and Brandon Dula — they’ve been just amazing, inspirational Black faculty members,” she said. “But there’s so many other ones, too.”
