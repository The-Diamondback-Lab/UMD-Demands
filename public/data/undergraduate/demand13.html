Over the summer, as protests against systemic racism and white supremacy spread across the country, University of Maryland students and alumni leaned into the movement, with some authoring petitions to enact change in their own communities.

Ultimately, <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/01/petition-advocacy-university-police-department-umpd-umd-university-of-maryland-george-floyd-racism-breonna-taylor/">nearly 1,400 people</a> signed onto a call to defund and reform University Police and more than 2,000 signed a petition urging the school to sever the tie between its police and its dorms.

Months later, these demands resurfaced in the list curated by Black student leaders at the request of university President Dr. Darryll Pines. In their 13th demand, these students are calling on the university to end the militarization of the University Police and to create a safe dorms environment by removing armed police and decreasing their presence in the resident halls.

Currently, the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/01/petition-advocacy-university-police-department-umpd-umd-university-of-maryland-george-floyd-racism-breonna-taylor/">Resident Assistant Duty and Emergency Response Manual</a> informs resident assistants that when a student appears to be a danger to themselves or others, either the RA or the resident director on duty should call University Police. According to this manual, RAs are also supposed to call the school’s police when they suspect drug use is happening in the dorms.

“We want to stop that, because the police don't keep us safe. And sometimes the police react to situations terribly, especially with Black people,” said Saba Tshibaka, a fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major and a co-founder of the anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter.

The university is currently examining the practices of its police department; on Pines’ first day in office, he announced the creation of a <a href="https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-community-policing">task force</a> that has been charged with providing recommendations for enhancing community policing on campus and building trust between the university community and law enforcement. That same day, he announced that the police department would be divesting from the 1033 program, a Defense Department initiative that supplies local law enforcement agencies with surplus military equipment.

The task force Pines convened is expected to release its recommendations at the end of the semester, and the recommendations will start being implemented in the next academic year, according to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>.

The campaign to demilitarize University Police has also been a gradual process. Students protested University Police’s involvement <a href="https://dbknews.com/2016/08/15/article_4c61d376-7412-11e4-b72c-77031654fd22-html/">in the 1033 program as early as 2016</a>, but it wasn’t until the push amid the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer that Pines and University Police Chief David Mitchell announced the department’s <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/15/1033-program-college-park-umd-university-of-maryland-military-defense-department-2/">withdrawal from the program</a>.

At some point, as a part of this program, the University Police had 62 reflex sights, 17 rear sights, 50 5.56 millimeter rifles, two 7.62 rifles used for ceremonies by the Honor Guard, 300 magazine cartridges, two Humvees, 25 5.56-millimeter rifles, 16 12-gage shotguns and an armored truck.

But according to the school’s <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>, the police department is “officially deactivated” from this program as of Feb. 22.

“For a long time, UMD has been taking in and creating an arsenal of weapons for themselves and the police department,” Tshibaka said.  “And it was unbeknownst to some people, but the people that knew about — who cared about not having a militarized force on campus — have always spoken out about it.”

In an interview with The Diamondback, this university’s Counseling Center Director Dr. Chetan Joshi shared additional steps he and Mitchell are taking to improve policing on the campus. He described a proposal that would allow mental health clinicians to respond to mental health emergencies alongside police officers. If it is determined that a person should be transported to the hospital, Joshi explained, the proposal would allow that trip to be taken in an ambulance instead of in a police car. He added that the proposal may change before it is ultimately reviewed and approved.

The changes under discussion aim to reduce the level of stress and trauma that people experience while facing a mental health emergency, Joshi explained. That stress and trauma can be exacerbated by being put in handcuffs to be transported to a hospital, Joshi said, particularly for Black and Indigenous students and other students of color. However, he noted, the reason students are placed in handcuffs is to protect themselves and the responding officers.

“So, being cognizant to that, we wanted to be sure that we approach any kind of mental health transfer going forward with care and sensitivity,” he said. “That was already being done, but we changed the procedures to really, really caring in terms of how the student is transferred.”
