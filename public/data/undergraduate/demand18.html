In their 18th demand, Black student leaders are calling upon the University of Maryland to establish a collaboration between Nyumburu Cultural Center and the Division of Student Affairs to “streamline all resources and counseling services that exist to support Black students.”

This demand is rooted in the desire to bolster communication between units throughout this university, said Saba Tshibaka, one of the founders of anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter and a fifth-year senior philosophy, politics and economics major.

“I actually think that might be the biggest issue at UMD,” she said. “It’s not even that the lines don’t exist, it’s that certain people refuse to amplify certain messages.”

Tshibaka criticized the student affairs division — as well as other administrative offices at this university — for not using their platforms to uplift the voices of Black students and their organizations more often. She suggested that Dr. Patty Perillo, student affairs vice president, use the emails she sends to students each week to amplify the work of the more than 30 Black student groups at the university.

According to the update posted to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a> in March, a “dyadic relationship” exists between the Counseling Center and Nyumburu, which allows the centers to share information about available services and other updates. The Counseling Center will also attend monthly meetings with the <a href="https://www.ssiumd.org">Student Success Initiative</a> executive board to discuss Black student mental health needs, initiatives and services, according to the update.

Additionally, Dr. Chetan Joshi, director of the Counseling Center, said his office maintains a liaison relationship with Nyumburu and other departments. These relationships allow the center to build trust with students from minority backgrounds and make it easier for them to “cross the bridge to seek the help that they need,” Joshi explained.

“I want students to reach out to me,” he said. “I’m happy to engage with students in a conversation about what the needs of minority students are and, through that, figure out what can be done to better address those things. That is something that I think is critical, that is important and I really, really want students to know that.”

Also according to the update, the university will establish consistent communication between Nyumburu and the Division of Student Affairs by this summer to ensure that its mental health services and resources are being communicated to students. Perillo has been meeting with Nyumburu staff each semester, according to the update, and has invited staff to join monthly meetings.

Dr. Ronald Zeigler, Nyumburu’s longtime director, said his center has a good relationship with the student affairs division. He said its staffers have visited the center’s programs before and that he has met with Perillo.

“She knows what we do and the kinds of things that we do over here,” he said.

Still, he thinks the students’ demand is valid, he said. He added that Nyumburu and the Division of Student Affairs should be able to improve how they communicate without combining their programs.

Nyumburu, for instance, has long hosted a program called the <a href="http://www.nyumburu.umd.edu/bmi_program.html">Black Male Initiative</a>, which aims to foster scholarship, brotherhood and activism among Black men to increase their retention rate at the university. Although the rate has increased over the years, as of fall 2016, 58 percent of Black students had either graduated or remained at the university after four years. For white students, this number was 77 percent.

The Counseling Center, meanwhile, has therapy groups like “Circle of Sisters,” a space for Black women to discuss personal concerns, relationships, sexuality and other topics, and “We Got Us!,” a 10-week group that aims to help Black undergraduates learn to better navigate higher education at a predominantly white institution. There are also walk-in hours for students of color at the Counseling Center from 3 to 4 p.m. every weekday.

“I don’t think it’s a matter of we’re not talking to each other or anything like that,” Zeigler said. “I just think that there are different ways in which things are being explored or being engaged.”

Tshibaka said this demand is connected to Demand 11, which calls for more spaces for Black people to gather on the campus. If these new spaces become available, she said, hopefully the Division of Student Affairs would help advertise them.

However, she noted, some people don’t even know about Nyumburu when they arrive at the university. <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/24/umd-black-terps-matter-teach-demands-protest-racism/">At a Black Terps Matter protest in July</a>, when the coalition’s organizers asked those in attendance whether they had been shown the center when they had toured the campus, only a handful of students raised their hands.

“It can never be implied that people know about or anyone knows about all the different resources that are available to them on campus,” Tshibaka said.
