This fiscal year, the University of Maryland’s Department of Public Safety is managing a budget of nearly $14 million, according to information The Diamondback obtained through a public information request. As of December 2020, this pool funded the salaries of 79 university police officers, among other expenses.

Anti-racist coalition Black Terps Matter co-founder Saba Tshibaka and other Black student leaders at the university call this amount of funding “excessive.”

“We're wondering, ‘Why do they need so much money?’ Are they keeping us safe? Are they stopping crimes from happening? Are they reducing the number of sexual assaults that happen to Black women? Are they stopping people from underage drinking?” Tshibaka asked. “Why are we paying them so much? It doesn’t make any sense.”

In their third demand, Black student leaders are calling for the university to “reevaluate and reduce” the funding University Police receives and to redistribute these funds and resources to Black organizations on the campus, including Nyumburu Cultural Center and the African American studies department.

In an update about this demand on the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/03/10/umd-demands-black-student-leaders-critical-issues-updates-dashboard/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>, the university referenced the <a href="https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-community-policing">Task Force on Community Policing</a> that university President Dr. Darryll Pines charged to provide recommendations to enhance campus public safety and build trust between public safety officials and the university community. Recommendations from this task force are expected by the end of this semester, according to the dashboard, and will begin to be implemented during the 2021-22 academic year.

The task force includes nearly 30 members, seven of whom are students. It also includes elected officials, professors, University Police officers and the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 23. So far, it has held four listening sessions with community members and issued a campuswide survey to gather community feedback, according to information provided by university spokesperson Natifia Mullings.

After the task force releases its recommendations, the administration will determine “what is doable and what is not doable” and discuss timelines, Pines said in an interview with The Diamondback. He also said he hopes to share this information in another town hall.

This demand was also included in a list of demands published by Black Terps Matter over the summer. So often, Tshibaka said, the Black community on the campus feels like it is on its own when it comes to fundraising. Undergraduate Black students have a better relationship with alumni than they do with the administration, “to put it lightly,” Tshibaka said.

More than 10,000 people have signed a <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/06/25/petition-demands-more-support-umd-african-american-studies-department-university-of-maryland/">petition</a> created over the summer that demands more support for the African American studies department. The creators of the petition asserted the program was neglected and pushed to make the department’s programming more available to students.

Dr. Ronald Zeigler, Nyumburu’s longtime director, explained that the center is funded through “self-support.” According to the <a href="http://www.nyumburu.umd.edu/giving.html">center’s website</a>, this means Nyumburu is responsible for generating revenue and that all revenue goes toward covering operating costs. Funding for the center comes from three sources, according to the website: student fees, revenue from room reservations and revenue from Camp Shule, a summer camp for kids in 3rd to 12th grade.

Since funding for the center partly depends on student enrollment, Zeigler explained that Nyumburu’s budget has been “up and down.” However, he also recounted some difficulties the center has had in securing funding from the Committee for the Review of Student Fees. Historically, he said, the Student Government Association has questioned the value of having a Black cultural center on the campus. He later added in an email that this relationship has “improved tremendously” over the years and said he hoped that trend would continue.

He also said Nyumburu has faced greater pushback in requesting fees than other units and departments around the campus.

“They put a proposal in, they get the money,” he said. “Whereas, we might want to get money to enhance our infrastructure for the technical staff and our technical capabilities and the money’s turned down. So, why is that?”

Tshibaka stressed the value of redistributing the funds from University Police to Black organizations around the campus. Although others have said the money would be put to good use at the Counseling Center or purchasing women’s health products, Tshibaka said she believes the right decision would be to give the money straight to the Black community.

“If you give the money to Black people, they will put it where the community needs it the most,” she said.
