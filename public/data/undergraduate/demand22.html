Nadia Owusu was set to start at the University of Maryland the semester after 1st Lt. Richard Collins, a Black Bowie State student, was stabbed to death on the campus by a former student of this university.

His murder, which happened in May 2017, left many students — including Owusu — questioning whether they should actually enroll at this university.

“This is the place you want to go to, but a Black man was murdered on this campus by a UMD student. So it calls into question, is this a safe place for me to go?” said Owusu, a senior government and politics major. “Is this a place that is safe for people that look like us?”

Collins’ death was something a lot of Black students had hanging over their heads, Owusu said. But some non-Black students at the time, she added, weren’t aware of what happened or didn’t understand the significance of Collins’ death.

In their 22nd demand, Owusu and other Black student leaders are calling for the university to continuously draw attention to Collins’ death and the impact it had locally and in the state of Maryland. The group wants the school to incorporate information about Collins’ life and legacy in campus tours, orientation and General Education courses.

“Without knowing history, history repeats itself,” Owusu said. “If something like this occurs, and the university’s students don't know about this and the greater community doesn't know about this –– there's not going to be a renewed effort to make sure this never happens again.”

In October, the university launched the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/10/02/umd-bowie-state-social-justice-alliance-richard-collins-murder/">Social Justice Alliance</a> with Bowie State University, which works to honor Collins’ memory and legacy through events, conferences and other programming. Additionally, Dr. Georgina Dodge, this university’s diversity and inclusion vice president, said the school’s new onboarding program TerrapinSTRONG acknowledges Collins’ murder.

The university is also working with the Collins family to design a memorial to honor their son. According to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the family is currently considering potential sites for the memorial. The school hopes to have this work completed by the fall, according to the page.

Collins would have turned 27 in December. An ROTC student who was days away from graduating, Collins is <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/12/09/richard-collins-legacy-foundation-scholarship-memorial-rotc-graduates-trial/">remembered by his friends and family</a> for his sage advice, leadership and generosity. The <a href="https://bowiestate.edu/admissions-and-aid/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/scholarship-opportunities/other-scholarships/leadership-with-honor.php">Richard W. Collins III Leadership with Honor Scholarship</a> — a scholarship that is now given each year in his name — provides funds to minority undergraduate and graduate students who are enrolled at one of the state of Maryland’s four historically Black colleges and universities and are ROTC cadets.

Any new courses introduced at the university discussing the history of racism and racial trauma in the United States should also cover Collins’ story, Owusu added.

“Everyone should know about Lt. Richard Collins III and know what occurred on this campus. This acts as a case study to what has occurred here and not that very long ago,” Owusu said. She added that it’s something the university should be open and honest about during campus tours and orientations, too.

“This is something that shook our community,” Owusu said. “We work every single day to make sure that it would never happen again.”
