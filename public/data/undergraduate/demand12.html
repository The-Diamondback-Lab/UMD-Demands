When Pauline Sow arrived at the University of Maryland as a freshman, she assumed most of her classmates would be from Prince George’s County, she said. After all, she said, that’s where the campus is located.

It didn’t take her long to realize that this wasn’t the case. Instead, as of last fall, about 12 percent of in-state students enrolled in the university were from the county. About 39  percent were from Montgomery County, just like Sow.

“You’d think that a school in [the county] would want to source from students that are in the same county,” said Sow, the Student Government Association’s diversity and inclusion director. “I think it kind of perpetuates the difference in wealth from [Prince George’s] and Montgomery County, the differences in education, the difference in everything — which are honestly problematic and, in part, racist, as well.”

As of the beginning of the 2020-21 school year, just over 55 percent of students enrolled in Prince George’s County Public Schools were Black, compared to about 21 percent in Montgomery County Public Schools. The Prince George’s County school system also has a lower graduation rate — about 76 percent, compared to about 89 percent for Montgomery County as of last year — and a higher percentage of kids eligible for the free school lunch program.

Now, Sow and other Black student leaders want to see this gap in admissions close. In their twelfth demand, they are calling upon the university to create partnerships and scholarships with Prince George’s County schools to increase the number of Prince Georgians — especially Black Prince Georgians — who are accepted and admitted to the university.

The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is “dedicated to providing access to information and resources that aid students and their families in pursuit of higher education,” according to information provided by the office. It also detailed partnerships the university has with the county, including scholarships, college preparedness programming and other community relationships.

In 2019, for instance, the university launched the Maryland Ascent Program at College Park Academy. The school has since expanded the program — which consists of four workshops and provides assistance with the college application process and identification of financial aid resources and scholarship programs — to all seniors at public and charter schools in the county.

In fall 2020, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions also launched the President’s Virtual High School Course Pilot: Calculus in PGCPS, which involved admitting and enrolling students for a calculus course offered to high school students as a concurrent opportunity for enrollment at this university.

According to the office, county students are also eligible for the university’s Incentive Awards program, which awards those selected with full tuition and living expenses consistent with financial need. The office also sets aside about 60 scholarships worth $5,000 for students admitted to the university from Baltimore City and Prince George’s County schools.

But Sow says there’s more to be done.

“Maryland exists as a bubble within [Prince George’s] that doesn’t give back to [Prince George’s] as much as it can,” she said. “As college students, we are set up to be one of the most privileged members of society. So, why not build relations with students who also seek to go to college?”

To do so, Sow suggested that the university’s clubs and student groups create connections with organizations that serve young people in the county. Fraternities and sororities could create tutoring services, she said, and club sports participants could coach softball or basketball teams in the county. Students also could donate their old SAT and ACT test prep books to county schools and give tips to county high schoolers about the college application process, she said.

Because, at the end of the day, she stressed, the viewpoint that, “OK, well students from [Prince George’s] are perfectly welcome to apply,” just isn’t good enough.

“I think that students will want to go to a school that they know and that they trust,” she said. “I would not trust the school that’s within my county that doesn’t strive to be visible to me. Because that makes it seem like you don’t want me.”
