Saba Tshibaka knows that Demand 2 — in which Black student leaders are pushing the university to hire three more Bias Incident Support Services employees — is possible.

In October 2019, the University of Maryland's Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/10/13/umd-title-ix-ocrsm-hire-new-staff-investigator/">brought on a new Title IX investigator</a> and hired two temporary staffers into permanent positions. At the start of that academic year, the office had had five empty positions, three of which were investigator roles; amid staffing shortages, the university had agreed to pay more than <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/09/23/umd-ocrsm-sexual-misconduct-investigators-contract-civil-rights/">$230,000 to bring on a pair of contract investigators</a> to help the office.

Now, Tshibaka and other Black student leaders want a similar increase in staffers for BISS.

Tshibaka said BISS should have more employees, especially because of how important it is; <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/bias/team/">BISS</a> is charged with responding to hate bias incidents, supporting students impacted by hate and providing education outreach to the campus.

“[The office] being understaffed is terrible,” Tshibaka said. “It very directly shows that they don't care about the students and that their first priority is not making sure that they have a good experience and aren't discriminated against.”

In an update posted to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>, the university says BISS currently has three staff members, including a director, program manager and graduate student staff member. A proposal is underway to hire a graduate assistant by May, according to the update. Dr. Van Bailey, the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/01/15/umd-diversity-inclusion-bias-support-services-personnel/">new director of BISS</a>, is also undertaking a review of staffing needs, which they expect to complete by the end of this year.

Tshibaka said she is looking forward to seeing some progress come with Bailey’s appointment. However, she pointed out that the program was without a permanent director for the entirety of the fall semester. She called this vacancy unacceptable, especially since this period overlapped with the social movement that broke out in the aftermath of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, among others.

Neijma Celestine-Donnor, the office’s former director, <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/07/27/umd-director-neijma-celestine-donnor-leaving/">left the position in July</a> to take a new job as assistant dean for diversity, equity and inclusion for the University of Maryland, Baltimore’s social work school. For about six months, Brian Medina, the office’s program manager, took over Celestine-Donnor’s responsibilities as the school searched for her replacement. The university ultimately hired Bailey in January, and he began in the role in February.

Before Celestine-Donnor hired <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/04/22/umd-hate-bias-incident-report-odi-data/">Medina in April 2020</a>, she handled the school’s response to hate bias incidents largely by herself; in <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/11/24/one-person-manages-most-of-umds-hate-bias-response-but-another-staffer-is-on-the-way/">November 2019</a>, she joked to The Diamondback that the “hate bias response program is me.” The role she held was created following the murder of 1st Lt. Richard Collins, a Black Bowie State University student who was stabbed by a white former student when he visited this campus in 2017.

Coming into their new role, Bailey said he wants to build on the work Medina has done to advance restorative practices on the campus, while also bringing more visibility to BISS and creating partnerships with students who would like to figure out what transformative practices could look like in their organizations.

Aside from these goals, however, Bailey said they want Black students to know he is there for them; as a Black person, he said they know what it is like to experience institutional harm both as a student and as a staff member.

“I want to continue to focus in on this trauma-informed lens,” he said, “so we can really get to healing.”

Tshibaka said she is hopeful about the future of BISS. However, she still plans to stay vigilant and to spread the word about the office’s resources.

“I'll be checking the website to make sure there's no three-month period that it goes without being updated and no new cases are put in,” Tshibaka said. “I'm just looking forward to seeing things actually progress.”
