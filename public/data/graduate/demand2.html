At the start of the letter that graduate student collective UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives wrote to University of Maryland President Darryll Pines over the summer, the group notes that not only is the university “predicated on a culture and history” of anti-Black racism, it is an “institution literally built on white supremacy.”

When the school was founded in 1856 as the Maryland Agricultural College, it was constructed on land European colonists stole from the <a href="https://stamp.umd.edu/LandAcknowledgment">Piscataway Conoy</a> people. At least 16 of the school’s first 24 university trustees were slaveholders; together, they enslaved a total of nearly 400 people. It would take almost a century after the school’s founding for it to allow a Black student to enroll.

Today, the university remains invested in institutions that have historically dehumanized Black people and other people of color in the state of Maryland and across the globe, UMD BLK Grads for BLK Lives says in its letter. These institutions include domestic police forces, the prison-industrial complex, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. military, according to the group.

To ensure the safety of Black graduate students who attend, work at and contribute to this university, UMD BLK Grads for BLK Lives is calling for the school to divest from these institutions and to release an audit that outlines its “financial, intellectual, and spatial relationships” to these organizations and other “institutions of violence.”

Lenora Knowles, a doctoral student in the Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies who supports the group’s demands, summarized the question underlining their core mission:

“How do we decolonize the university and have it actually serve the folks that are attending and the communities that they represent?”

<h3>Maryland Correctional Enterprises</h3>

When Jordan Ealey found out that much of the furniture at this university was produced by incarcerated people employed by Maryland Correctional Enterprises, it altered Ealey’s perception of the school in unexpected ways.

Considering the specific way the prison-industrial complex and the school-to-prison pipeline victimizes Black and brown people, Ealey thought about how easily it could be Ealey or any number of Ealey’s colleagues caught up in this system. And because this university is far from the only one entangled with these structures, Ealey also thought about how this university fits within the broader scheme of American higher education.

“What does that mean for us to produce knowledge for these institutions that can only invest in us because of the suppression, the subjection, whatever, of others?” said Ealey, a doctoral student studying theatre and performance studies who supports the collective’s demands. “It almost makes you complicit. You are a part of it. And that’s the sad part.”

Just as Black undergraduate student leaders do in their 25 demands, UMD BLK Grads for BLK Lives is also calling for the university to divest from Maryland Correctional Enterprises — the state prison system’s industrial arm — and all other forms of prison labor.

The university said it would continue to study its relationship with Maryland Correctional Enterprises, according to an update posted on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">dashboard</a> tracking its progress on the 25 demands from undergraduate Black student leaders. In the update, the webpage also said it would invite speakers and experts to offer the campus community insight about the prison system and how it interacts with higher education institutions in the state. For example, according to the update, Reginald Dwayne Betts — a writer, public speaker and advocate for incarcerated people — participated in the university’s <a href="https://president.umd.edu/grandchallenges">Grand Challenges of Our Time</a> speaker series.

More than 70 percent of the state’s prison population was Black in July 2018, even though Black people make up just 31 percent of the state’s overall population, according to a 2019 report from the <a href="http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/Rethinking_Approaches_to_Over_Incarceration_MD.pdf">Justice Policy Institute</a>. Additionally, incarcerated people employed by Maryland Correctional Enterprises are paid anywhere from 17 cents an hour to $1.16 an hour — a steep difference from the state’s $11.75 minimum wage, which is set to rise to $15 per hour by January 2025.

In its letter, UMD BLK Grads for BLK Lives identifies the racial disparities within the system and the meager wages afforded to those employed by the enterprises as an “emergency.”

“UMD has a direct operating role in this violence, and it is the responsibility of the University to begin reparative work, starting with divestment,” the letter reads.

Under <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2013/article-gsf/section-14-103/">Maryland law</a>, the University System of Maryland is required to use the enterprises as a preferred source when buying supplies — meaning incarcerated people made much of the furniture that fills the system’s 12 member institutions. According to the enterprises’ 2020 report, the system ranked third among its top customers during the 2020 fiscal year, with a total purchase of $7 million worth of products.

Recognizing that the system’s dependence on prison labor isn’t entirely in its control, UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives is calling on Ross Stern, the university’s executive director of government relations, to lobby for state legislation to end this relationship. To do so, the letter reads, would uphold the university’s “high ethical standards.”

<h3>Policing</h3>

In its letter, UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives calls police an “inherently violent colonial enterprise.” Though the modern-day <a href="https://time.com/4779112/police-history-origins/">police force</a> began in the early 1900s, the origins of policing stretch back to the South in the 1700s, when patrol forces were formed to capture enslaved people who had run away, and to northern cities in the 1800s, when police forces were created to control the large waves of Catholic, Irish, Italian, German and Eastern European immigrants moving into urban centers.

To ensure the safety of all members of the campus community, UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives is calling upon the university to divest from policing by ending its contracts with the Prince George’s County Police Department and disbanding its own police department. As an alternative to the current system of policing, the group calls for the university to fund holistic, “care-filled” and community-led efforts, including hiring and training staff in mental health emergency protocols, de-escalation tactics, conflict mediation, nonviolent communication and “other transformative justice strategies for addressing harm that may emerge.”

On university President Dr. Darryll Pines’ first day in office, he announced that University Police would divest from the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/06/19/1033-program-department-of-defense-umpd-university-of-maryland-david-mitchell-george-floyd/">Defense Department’s 1033 program</a>, which provides excess military equipment to local law enforcement. According to an update posted on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, the police department was officially deactivated from the program as of Feb. 22.

On the same day, Pines announced that the university would create a task force to enhance community policing on the campus and to build trust between law enforcement and the university community. The <a href="https://president.umd.edu/administration/commissions-task-forces-and-councils/task-force-community-policing">task force</a> — which includes nearly 30 members, including students, elected officials, University Police officers and a Fraternal Order of Police president — is expected to issue a report by the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/03/08/umd-policing-task-force-pushes-back-recommendations-release/">end of the spring semester</a>. According to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues webpage</a>, these recommendations will start being implemented during the 2021-22 academic year.

<h3>ICE</h3>

In its letter, UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives also called on the university to not renew its $625,000 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when it expires at the end of March 2022 and to officially commit to becoming a sanctuary campus — joining a long list of student activists who have been urging the school to bolster its protections for undocumented students for years.

Now, these students finally have something to celebrate. In late March, Laurie Locascio, this university’s research vice president, informed student leaders that the agency did not exercise the final year in its contract with the school. As a result, the contract lapsed. And, Locascio announced, the university <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/03/31/umd-ice-contract-ends-lapse-renew/">will not renew it this year</a>.

In statements posted on social media following Locascio’s announcement, the Student Government Association and Political Latinxs United for Movement and Action in Society expressed relief and excitement.

Earlier this year, PLUMAS formed a coalition with student groups — including MaryPIRG, the NAACP, the Black Alliance Network and the Prison Resistance project — to bolster its fight to push the school to end its contract with the agency and become a sanctuary campus, said Amy Rivera, the president of PLUMAS.

Before Locascio’s announcement, the sophomore criminology and criminal justice and government and politics major said it was inspiring to see so many groups unite under one mission.

“When we all come together for a common cause it just makes us all that much stronger and that much more passionate and that much more confident within ourselves, knowing that there are people there to help you up and there’s people there that you can help uplift as well,” she said. “It means a lot to have this huge support system to try to protect those who are most vulnerable within our community.”

According to a list of <a href="https://thestamp.umd.edu/Engagement/Immigrant_Undocumented_Student_Life_Program/Terminology_and_ICE_Contract_FAQ">frequently asked questions</a> about the contract on Stamp Student Union’s website, the university’s contract was with the Homeland Security Investigations division of the agency — not the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, which detains and deports undocumented immigrants.

Under the contract, which began in 2017, the university’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism provided cultural competency and counterterrorism training to special agents stationed at embassies abroad. Under the terms of the contract, the consortium provided up to five two-day training seminars each year to inform investigators about the origins, ideologies and methods associated with international terrorism.

“Without the involvement of nonpartisan research universities, contracts like these could instead be awarded to groups and organizations with a clear political agenda,” Stamp’s webpage reads. “It is because of our values of diversity and inclusion, tolerance and intellectual freedom, the role of science in policy and practice, and our commitment to our students, that we do the work that we do, in the way that we do it.”

In an interview with The Diamondback before Locascio’s announcement, Pines clarified that the president’s office had no control over whether the faculty members who hold the contract at START choose to renew it.

“With respect to any contract at the University of Maryland that’s research-oriented or academic, the president allows for pure academic freedom for the researchers to apply for grants that they think are helpful, and I think this is very helpful to our country,” he said. “I think there’s just a focus on this topic, but not a true understanding of what the work is being done … This just seems to be for them a motherhood and apple pie issue.”

“But when you look into the details of the research that we’re doing, it’s absolutely relevant to helping the United States be safe, both in domestic and foreign terrorism,” he went on. “It has nothing to do with enforcement at the border.”

Pines also said that it’s important for the campus community to know that the university stands with its undocumented students.

In 2017, in response to a letter from a coalition of student groups called ProtectUMD, then-university President Wallace Loh called the step of making the university a sanctuary campus “unnecessary.” According to Stamp’s FAQs, the policies of University Police are consistent with those of Prince George’s County under their concurrent jurisdiction agreement — meaning university officers do not honor ICE detainers without a warrant.

“We value our diverse campus community. Every day members of the University of Maryland Police Department work tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of our campus community. UMPD is a service-oriented agency. Our priority is in keeping our campus safe and being a resource for those who need help,” the FAQs read.

In their statement about the end of the ICE contract, Student Government Association President Dan Alpert and Vice President Nabila Prasetiawan urged the school to reaffirm its sanctuary policies and commitments to the undocumented community. They also called upon the school to update its policies on how University Police interact with undocumented students and those protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and to develop a rapid response to student and staff deportation.

“We all must continue to work together as we pursue the safety and wellbeing of the campus’s immigrant and undocumented community,” Alpert and Prasetiawan wrote in the statement.
