When Hannah Sanders was studying public policy as an undergraduate at the Ohio State University, she remembers assessing case studies to determine how a program or plan might play out if implemented on a larger scale.

Today, she points to the student affairs concentration within the University of Maryland’s higher education, student affairs and international education policy doctoral program as an indication of what can happen when faculty members of color are in charge; the concentration is led by five women of color, including three Black women.

“Look at the scholarship that they are producing. Look at the work that they are doing to change our field of student affairs for the better,” said Sanders, a student in the concentration. “My program ... is a testament to the fact that diversity is needed and that Black people do have the ability to really produce great scholarship when they’re in an environment that helps them grow.”

As of the fall, the education college had the highest percentage of Black faculty members at the university at nearly 14 percent. Overall, however, only about six percent of faculty at the university were Black, and only about five percent of tenured or tenure-track faculty were Black.

UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives wants the university to turn these numbers around. The letter the graduate student collective authored over the summer — which Sanders signed — calls for the school to double the number of Black faculty members who are tenured and on the tenure track by 2024. Plus, the group and its allies want the university to make the retention of current Black faculty members a priority by “ensuring their research is supported with funding for conferences, timely sabbaticals to finish manuscripts, and a reasonable teaching load.”

The benefits of employing Black and Indigenous teachers, as well as other teachers of color, are well-documented. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-importance-of-a-diverse-teaching-force/">Studies</a> show that when students of color from the years of kindergarten through 12th grade have at least one teacher who is of their same race, they perform better on <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/86/1/195/57486/Teachers-Race-and-Student-Achievement-in-a">standardized tests</a>, have <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp9554.pdf">improved attendance</a> and are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0162373717693109">suspended less frequently</a>. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40197402?seq=1">Another 2006 study</a> found that faculty of color employ active and collaborative teaching techniques and interact with students more frequently than their white colleagues.

However, five schools and colleges at this university have a percentage of Black faculty members below the six percent average university-wide. Less than two percent of faculty members employed by the computer, math and natural sciences college last semester were Black. And after Dr. Christopher Foreman retired last year, the public policy school no longer has any Black faculty members who are tenured or on the tenure track.

The university is currently taking steps to better recruit and retain STEM faculty members from underrepresented backgrounds; at the start of 2021, it began its involvement in the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/12/31/aspire-alliance-umd-university-of-maryland-faculty-diversity-and-inclusion/">Aspire Alliance</a>, a program funded by the National Science Foundation that seeks to attract more students from marginalized backgrounds into science, technology, engineering and math college programs and support their graduation and entry into the workforce.

Additionally, according to an update posted to the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues website</a>, the school made several exceptions to it’s pandemic-prompted hiring freeze for underrepresented minority faculty members with whom they are “actively negotiating.” The university has also communicated to all departments that increasing diversity among faculty, staff and students is a priority, and it is developing “financial incentives” to enable the school to compete with other employers, according to the update.

According to information shared by the graduate school, though it has no role in hiring faculty, it does partner with the Office of Faculty Affairs to train new faculty members in best practices for mentoring graduate students. These training include addressing the “dimensions of diversity” that play into mentoring relationships, as well as the effects of conscious and unconscious assumptions and biases that could affect mentoring behaviors, according to the information. The school also supports the evaluations of graduate student advising and mentoring in promotion and tenure decisions, according to information the school provided.

Dr. Georgina Dodge, diversity and inclusion vice president, shared additional information about the difficulties the university would face in doubling the number of Black faculty by 2024. Many universities across the country are currently trying to diversify their faculty, Dodge said, and higher education is not an extremely diverse space at the moment. Additionally, she said, the university has to make sure it’s employing fair hiring practices — which means not setting quotas and hiring the most qualified candidate, regardless of their identity. However, she added, this doesn’t mean that the school can’t have conversations about what it defines as qualifications.

Still, she went on, the larger mission the school must carry out is creating an inclusive and welcoming campus environment that attracts underrepresented faculty members — and makes them want to stay.

“That’s really important because when you hire someone, whether it’s faculty or staff, and then lose them immediately, that’s just not a good business practice,” Dodge said. “It has a negative impact on the institution. So, we need to create a culture where people feel very welcomed, so that we don’t have a revolving door.”

Sanders stressed the power representation can have for students. Graduate school is hard, she said. Having faculty members who share your identity or background can make all the difference, she said.

“It can really make or break your experience to have someone to go to and say, ‘These are the struggles I’m facing,’” she said. “And they can say, ‘I’m facing those struggles as well,’ or, ‘I have faced them. And this is how I got through.’”
