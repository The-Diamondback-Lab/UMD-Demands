As of the fall semester, about 23 percent of Black graduate students at the University of Maryland had an assistantship — the second-lowest proportion of a racial or ethnic group after American Indian and Alaska Natives, according to data from the school’s Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment.

For comparison, about 33 percent of white graduate students and about 53 percent of foreign graduate students had an assistantship last semester. Of those categorized with an “unknown” race or ethnicity, 66 percent had an assistantship.

In its letter, graduate student collective UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives called upon the university to increase the number of full assistantships awarded to current and incoming Black graduate students and to provide full assistantships to all unfunded Black graduate students by 2021. The organization and its allies also called for the university to offer each current Black graduate student an additional year of funding in recognition of anti-Blackness as an “impediment to research and time-to-degree.”

Hannah Sanders, a master’s student studying student affairs in the education college, works as a graduate assistant for the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life. Most of her friends in her program have assistantships, too, she said. But finding an assistantship shouldn’t rest on whether a graduate student is lucky enough to have the connections needed to do so, Sanders said.

“My program does a lot to try to connect you with assistantships, but I think that it’s just hard to find them if you don’t have someone walking you through that process,” said Sanders, who signed onto the UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives letter. “So, at the very least, I do think that more needs to be done in terms of educating people about how you find them.”

According to information provided by the graduate school, graduate assistantships are provided by individual departments and faculty principal investigators, not the graduate school. University assistantships are also not awarded based on race, according to the information.

Additionally, no doctoral program had a proportion of Black graduate assistantships that was significantly different from the proportion of Black students, according to the information. For doctoral programs that made graduate assistant appointments this semester, 4.73 percent of graduate assistants were Black and 4.97 percent of students were Black.

For master’s programs that made graduate assistant appointments this semester, 10.1 percent of graduate assistants were Black and 11.1 percent of students were Black, according to the information provided. Three master’s programs had a proportion of Black graduate assistants that was statistically different from the proportion of Black students, according to this information — but in all three of these cases, the proportion of Black graduate assistants was higher than the proportion of Black students.

Graduate assistantships — which include teaching, administrative and research assistantships — provide students with the “financial resources necessary to pursue their degrees,” according to the <a href="https://gradschool.umd.edu/funding/assistantship-information">graduate school’s website</a>. These resources include a stipend, tuition remission and benefits, such as parental accommodations and health care.

However, although graduate assistants may raise job-related concerns in monthly meetings with administrators, they are barred from unionizing under state law. Graduate student advocates have worked to change this for years. In February, graduate student workers from this university and other University System of Maryland institutions testified in favor of a <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/02/19/usm-graduate-students-collective-bargaining-rights/">state bill</a> that would grant them collective bargaining rights.

Dr. Steve Fetter, dean of the graduate school, testified against the bill at that hearing. As he has in previous years, Fetter detailed the advantages the school has afforded to graduate student workers without them having the right to unionize; the average stipend for graduate assistants is $22,000 per year, for instance. He also later said that raising stipends is his highest priority.

The Graduate Assistant Advisory Committee, the group that represents graduate student workers in monthly meetings with administrators, signed onto the UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives letter over the summer. That’s because the committee’s members care deeply about racial justice, GAAC President Alexander Dunphy said, adding that fighting for these issues is part of the reason the group is pushing for the right to unionize.

“Without legal protections, without the status of employees and the rights that come along with it and without a seat at the table, graduate students in general are often powerless,” he said. “I think that is most deeply felt among marginalized communities.”

He says GAAC has heard of instances where graduate assistants have been made to feel uncomfortable by racist incidents and attitudes from their supervisors but have been afraid to say anything because of the repercussions they could face.

“As it stands now, they probably should be afraid because there’s not really much protections for grads,” he said. “There are some <a href="https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/graduate/policies/policies-graduate-assistantships/#text">grievance procedures</a>, but it’s mostly in-house. And if your adviser is your supervisor and is a big name at the university, that power imbalance — most grads probably would just rather not [come forward].”
