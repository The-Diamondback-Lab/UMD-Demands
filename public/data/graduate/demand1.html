Jehnae Linkins was still studying biomechanics and movement science at the University of Delaware when 1st Lt. Richard Collins headed down to College Park to hang out with some friends, days before he was set to graduate from Bowie State University. Later that night, a then-University of Maryland student would plunge a three-inch pocket knife into the young man’s chest, killing him. Collins was 23 years old.

Nearly four years later, the man who murdered Collins has been <a href="https://dbknews.com/2021/01/14/umd-sean-urbanski-murder-1st-lt-richard-collins-iii-bowie-state-university-maryland-trial-hearing-sentence/">sentenced to life in prison</a>. However, the bus stop in front of Montgomery Hall where Collins was fatally stabbed is still there. An iron chain hangs before the shelter, intended to keep students from sitting on its bench. A photograph of Collins dressed in his Army service uniform is attached to the wall. Beside it, a poster tells passersby the stop has been “temporarily relocated” to near Annapolis Hall out of respect.

Among the demands detailed in a letter authored by graduate student collective UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives over the summer, the first is for a permanent memorial to honor Collins’ life and memory. Linkins, who heard of Collins’ murder from a friend and participated in the working group that helped write the demands, said the collective doesn’t have anything specific in mind. She said they would support anything Collins’ family would like.

“Our point was just to say that we haven’t forgotten,” said Linkins, president of the Black Graduate Student Union.

The call for a physical memorial for Collins has been regularly echoed since 2017. Black student leaders included this demand in their list of 25 critical issues; they are also requesting that the university reference the young man’s legacy on campus tours and orientations and in General Education courses, including his accomplishments and the scholarship created in his name: the <a href="https://mhec.maryland.gov/preparing/Pages/FinancialAid/ProgramDescriptions/prog_RichardWCollinsIIILeadershipwHScholarship.aspx">Richard W. Collins III Leadership with Honor Scholarship</a>.

Leaders from this university have repeatedly promised that a memorial will eventually be constructed on the campus. In 2018, then-university President Dr. Wallace Loh wrote in a <a href="https://dbknews.com/2018/04/10/richard-collins-murder-memorial-umd-wallace-loh/">university-wide email</a> that the school was not proceeding with any plans at that time out of respect for the family’s request for privacy, but that there would come a time in the “near future” where the campus would come together to heal and memorialize Collins’ life.

Last semester, newly-appointed university President Dr. Darryll Pines <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/09/24/umd-sga-pines-workers-safety-collins-memorial/">told the Student Government Association</a> that the school would announce an update on Collins’ memorial in the coming weeks and that the school had already designed one. The Collins family did not want to move forward with the memorial before the man who killed their son was sentenced, he explained.

The school is currently working with the Collins family on the location and the design of a physical memorial for their son, according to an update the university posted on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">dashboard</a> tracking its progress on the 25 demands issued by Black student leaders. The university is aiming for this work to be completed by fall 2021, according to the update.

In the meantime, however, this university has taken other steps to honor Collins' life alongside Bowie State University, where Collins went to school and participated in the ROTC program. In October, the two schools held a virtual launch introducing their new <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/10/02/umd-bowie-state-social-justice-alliance-richard-collins-murder/">Social Justice Alliance</a>, which was created to celebrate Collins’ legacy and stimulate conversation about social justice on both campuses. Recently, the alliance hosted a viewing of the documentary After Selma, which featured a discussion with civil rights activist Joanne Bland and filmmaker Loki Mulholland.

Jordan Ealey, a doctoral student studying theatre and performance studies who supports the UMD BLK Grads for BLK Lives demands, doesn’t want the university to get caught up in symbols. But Ealey does want to ensure the history of Collins’ murder is something the school is constantly reckoning with.

“For me … it’s about that reminder and that consistent acknowledgement that racism is not this far-past thing. Anti-Blackness is not this far-past thing. It is something that is in the present,” Ealey said. “It needs to consistently be addressed. And people who come here need to know what happened.”

Ealey had already made the decision to come to graduate school at this university when Collins was murdered. When Ealey arrived on the campus, Collins’ death was always in the back of Ealey’s mind, even when Ealey wasn’t consciously thinking about it. It remained in the undercurrent.

That’s the thing about the Black Lives Matter, Ealey said. Yes, it’s a protest movement, Ealey said, but it is also the practice of naming and caring for the people who have died; it’s about the brutality of policing, but it is also about the importance of remembering people and mourning them, Ealey said. Ealey will never forget the names of Trayvon Martin or Breonna Taylor, George Floyd or Islan Nettles — not for as long as Ealey lives.

“So I think it’s important to have that honoring of Lt. Richard Collins, because his life mattered,” Ealey said. “He was a person. And you can’t just clean up the spot and think, ‘That’s OK,’ and, ‘It’s over.’ It needs to be something that is recognized officially as something that actually shook up the campus. Because it did.”
