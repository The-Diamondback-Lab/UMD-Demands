During Jehnae Linkins’ first year as a mechanical engineering doctoral student at the University of Maryland, she was a teaching assistant for a class of about 360 students, she said. She was responsible for teaching and grading about 100 of those students in a discussion section, she said. The next semester, she split a class of about 200 students with another teaching assistant.

It was a lot, she said, especially considering she was only making about $750 a week after taxes. To supplement her income, she worked four other jobs.

“It wasn’t a good environment,” said Linkins, president of the Black Graduate Student Union. “And it wasn’t conducive for my workload.”

In the letter that graduate student collective UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives authored over the summer, the group calls for the university to bar graduate students from teaching more than one class per semester, including discussion sections or multiple sections of one course. The group also calls for the university to make one of each graduate student’s funded years a fellowship year to allow them to “pursue their research and scholarship with relative safety and comfort.“

Graduate assistantships are funded and supervised by departments and departmental faculty members, according to information shared by the graduate school. Graduate assistants are also limited to working 20 hours per week on average throughout the course of the entire semester, according to this information.

Those who find themselves working more than this amount are encouraged to work with their supervisor to adjust their duties, and, if that doesn’t work, they should report the issue to the director of graduate studies in their department, their department chair or the <a href="https://president.umd.edu/administration/administrative-offices/university-maryland-ombuds-services">graduate school ombuds officer</a>, according to information provided by the graduate school. If that doesn’t work, according to the shared information, students can file a <a href="https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/graduate/policies/policies-graduate-assistantships/#text">formal grievance with the graduate school</a>.

Additionally, as of <a href="https://dbknews.com/2018/09/05/umd-graduate-assistants-supervisor-meeting-required/">fall 2018</a>, supervisors are required to meet with their graduate assistants at the start of each term to discuss the responsibilities and duties they will be expected to complete throughout the term.

The group and its allies are also calling for the university to eradicate its use of course evaluations, writing that they are often used as "vehicles for expressions of bigotry," especially due to anti-Blackness and the patriarchy.

UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives isn’t the first group to speak out against the use of course evaluations. In 2019, the American Sociological Association and 23 other professional organizations released a <a href="https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/asa_statement_on_student_evaluations_of_teaching_feb132020.pdf">statement</a> urging colleges and universities to stop using student evaluations of teaching in high-stakes personnel decisions. The statement cites research showing that student evaluations are weakly related to other measures of teaching effectiveness, are used in “statistically problematic ways” and can be influenced by characteristics such as the time of day, subject and class size.

The statement also cites observational studies and experiments that have found student evaluations of instructors to be biased against women and people of color; for instance, <a href="https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.14293/S2199-1006.1.SOR-EDU.AETBZC.v1">students rate</a> women instructors <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269288475_What%27s_in_a_Name_Exposing_Gender_Bias_in_Student_Ratings_of_Teaching">lower than they rate men</a>, even when they practice the same teaching behaviors, and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-22434-001">Black and Asian faculty members are evaluated less positively than white faculty</a>, especially by students who are white men.

In January 2017, the school’s Teaching and Learning Transformation Center sent a proposal to the University Senate recommending that the school work to improve its course evaluation system. In its proposal, the center references research that identified “significant bias in most student course evaluations that disadvantage female, ethnic minority, and other groups of instructors.”

The current course evaluation system was introduced in 2007 and includes 15 questions that are answered on a scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” The first seven questions are seen by instructors and “<a href="https://confluence.umd.edu/display/courseeval/Course+Evaluation+Items">authorized campus administrators</a>.” Responses to these questions are <a href="https://bsosundergrad.umd.edu/academics/course-evaluations">reviewed by</a> department chairs, undergraduate directors, deans, merit review committees and promotion and tenure committees; they are used to assess and improve faculty performance, according to an informational page on the <a href="https://confluence.umd.edu/display/courseeval/Course+Evaluation+Items">system’s website</a>.

Evaluations also include eight close-ended questions, where the responses can be viewed by instructors and <a href="https://bfs-trans3.umd.edu/evalrpt/search;jsessionid=F640FA282F90E831ECAC2220B5F0B8D8.1">students</a>, if 70 percent or more of the students in the class completed the evaluation. Courses with a teaching assistant include <a href="https://confluence.umd.edu/display/courseeval/Course+Evaluation+Items">three close-ended questions</a> about their performance; responses to these questions are viewed by the teaching assistant, instructors teaching with them and campus administrators.

In the months following the Teaching and Learning Transformation Center’s proposal, a University Senate subcommittee convened to determine how the school’s course evaluation system could be improved. Between July 2017 and January 2019, subcommittee members consulted with students and reviewed course evaluation practices at Big Ten and peer institutions. It also met with experts in the field — including two educational psychologists at the university — and consulted research conducted by the school, which included information on bias in course evaluations.

Among other issues, the subcommittee found that evaluation results are sometimes used as the sole — or the most significant — factor in making renewal or promotion decisions for instructional faculty. Additionally, some instructors expressed concern that responses to open-ended questions could be “biased and even abusive.” In an effort to alleviate these concerns, the school’s Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment added a paragraph before such questions urging students to be thoughtful and constructive when writing comments.

“Inappropriate or offensive comments do not reflect the civil engagement we value as an institution, and they are generally not effective in stimulating improvements to instruction,” the paragraph reads. “Should any comments take the form of actual threats, they will be forwarded, with the student’s identifying information, to campus police for threat assessment.”

According to the <a href="https://www.senate.umd.edu/system/files/resources/billDocuments/16-17-24/stage9/Presidential_Approval_16-17-24.pdf">University Senate’s final report</a>, when its Academic Procedures and Standards Committee reviewed the subcommittee’s recommendations, it considered whether university-wide assessments of teaching should be discontinued altogether. However, the committee ultimately decided otherwise.

“Ultimately, the committee determined that collecting University-wide data on student experiences serves a useful purpose that should be continued and improved,” the final report reads. “Its recommendations are premised on a belief that the University should take this opportunity to reimagine the instrument in light of current best practices; narrow its purpose; and develop a tool that provides more and better information to administrators, instructors and students.”

In October 2019, then-university President Dr. Wallace Loh signed off on the committee’s <a href="https://www.senate.umd.edu/system/files/resources/billDocuments/16-17-24/stage9/Presidential_Approval_16-17-24.pdf">finalized recommendations</a>. Among other suggestions, the report advises the university to consider ways to ensure that course evaluation results aren’t used as the sole basis for teaching awards and assessing the progress toward accreditation standards. The report additionally recommends revising the questions on course evaluations so they focus on issues where students are the best or only source of data and solicit feedback that can inform actionable changes by the instructor.

Though the report acknowledges that open-ended comments can be abused, it notes that the committee decided the value is significant enough that they should still be included. The committee recommends using specific prompts for two open-ended questions related to “positive aspects” and “areas for improvement” in hopes that this may reduce the number of biased comments.

The university’s Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment has convened a group that is currently working to revise student course evaluation questions, according to an update posted on the <a href="https://diversity.umd.edu/black-student-leaders/">Critical Issues dashboard</a>.
