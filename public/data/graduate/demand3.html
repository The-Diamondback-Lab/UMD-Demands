Jehnae Linkins is a proud graduate of Lincoln University, the nation’s first degree-granting historically Black college or university. That’s where she got her undergraduate degree in physics.

Then, after a three-year stint at the University of Delaware, she arrived at the University of Maryland to study mechanical engineering. She said she still remembers the moment she realized how few Black women she was surrounded by.

“We were in the [Kim Engineering Building], and I turned around and looked at everybody,” recalled Linkins, president of the Black Graduate Student Union. “I was like, ‘Oh my God.’”

Of the 229 graduate students enrolled in the mechanical engineering department last semester, only 11 were Black, according to the university’s Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment. Overall, about nine percent of graduate students were Black.

The collective behind the summer’s letter, UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives, wants this to change. That organization and its allies are calling for the university to invest greater funding in recruitment efforts for Black students, bringing the proportion of Black graduate students to 16 percent by 2022. The percentage has ticked up slightly since the group authored the letter over the summer, with last semester’s number up from eight percent Black faculty as of fall 2019.

The deficit of Black graduate students is a nationwide trend. Black students only made up about five percent of those who earned doctoral degrees in 2015, according to data from <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/datatables/tab-19.htm">the National Science Foundation</a>. In comparison, white students earned 52 percent of the degrees.

In its letter, UMD BLK Grads For BLK Lives includes two demands meant to lower the barriers to entry for graduate school. The group calls for the university to provide fee waivers to all Black prospective students who are applying for graduate school in 2021 and to stop requiring the GRE entry exam for admissions.

Information provided by the graduate school listed ways in which it is seeking to increase its enrollment of underrepresented students. The Office of Graduate Diversity and Inclusion leads campuswide recruiting efforts of students from underrepresented groups and convenes <a href="https://gradschool.umd.edu/node/4113">a diversity recruitment working group</a>, according to the information.

The same office also funds the <a href="https://gradschool.umd.edu/funding/student-fellowships-awards/ronald-e-mcnair-graduate-fellowship">Ronald E. McNair Graduate Fellowship</a>, ensures that all fellowship awards reflect the university’s “commitment to diversity” and works with programs to provide enhanced financial support for top applicants who belong to underrepresented groups, according to the information.

Additionally, according to the <a href="https://gradschool.umd.edu/feewaiverinformation">graduate school’s website</a>, application fee waivers are available for prospective students who are members of certain programs and organizations, many of which — including the National Society of Black Engineers and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society — serve Black and Indigenous students and other students of color.

According to the information provided by the graduate school, graduate school admissions decisions are made at the program level. However, the graduate school promotes “holistic admissions” and encouraged programs to consider waiving GRE requirements amid the pandemic, according to the information. The graduate school also advised programs against using cut-off scores, according to the information, and does not consider the GRE in fellowship decisions.

According to information from the graduate school, it will continue to encourage programs to use holistic admissions practices that consider a wide range of factors and to avoid putting undue weight on GRE scores in the admissions process. It will also continue to urge programs not to use cut-off scores.

This university isn’t the first to move away from the GRE. Considering that studies have shown the exam is a <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/study-graduate-record-exam-shows-it-does-little-predict-graduate-school-success">poor predictor</a> of a student’s potential to succeed in graduate school — and that scores tend to skew higher for students who are white, male and more affluent — the test has already fallen out of favor among hundreds of graduate programs. In 2018 alone, 44 percent of America’s top molecular biology graduate programs dropped the GRE as an application requirement, an <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/05/wave-graduate-programs-drop-gre-application-requirement">investigation</a> by Science found.

Even <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2020/06/graduate-programs-drop-gre-after-online-version-raises-concerns-about-fairness">more programs</a> have either made the exam optional or gotten rid of the requirement for good during the coronavirus pandemic, citing concerns that the online version of the test disadvantages prospective students living in rural areas or from low-income backgrounds; test-takers <a href="https://www.ets.org/s/cv/gre/at-home/test-day/">must have</a> access to a computer with a web camera, have stable internet access and be able to ensure that nobody enters the room while they are taking the four-hour exam.

Before the graduate school starts recruiting more Black students, however, Linkins emphasized that it needs to make other changes to create a more inclusive environment. As of right now, she doesn’t feel comfortable encouraging prospective Black graduate students to come to the university.

“The engineering school is great, don’t get me wrong, but it’s all the other bullshit that they possibly could have to deal with,” she said. “I’m not going to lie to them, and say, ‘Come here, the school is great.’ I could not, genuinely, have that on my conscience.”
