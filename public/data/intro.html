It began almost a year ago.

Last spring, as protests exploded across the country following the killing of George Floyd, administrators at the University of Maryland sent a meeting invitation to the members of more than 30 Black student groups. During a time of so much pain and trauma, the officials wanted to know how the school could better support Black students — how they could help them feel included, valued, seen and safe on the campus.

The meetings continued from there, once every three to four weeks. Ultimately, university President Dr. Darryll Pines convened a task force of five student leaders to draw up a list of issues for the school to address. In October, the students — undergraduates Saba Tshibaka, Adam Ahmed, Nadia Owusu and Pauline Sow, and doctoral student Jehnae Linkins — delivered their list to the university. By November, it was published on the school’s website.

The demands — referred to as “critical issues” on the university's website — encompass a wide variety of topics, including campus policing, mental health services for Black students and the university’s relationship with Prince George’s County.

A collective of Black graduate students, UMD BLK Grads for BLK Lives, also sent its own list of demands to the university administration over the summer, in a letter signed by more than 200 people. Last month, school officials met with the group for the first time. In a recent interview with The Diamondback, Dr. Patty Perillo, student affairs vice president, noted that the school has already addressed some of the demands from these students and may need to negotiate the timeline for meeting others. She and other administrators will, however, continue regularly meeting with the students, she said.

Below, The Diamondback explores the history, context and motivation behind each of the students’ demands, including the steps the university has taken to address them so far.
